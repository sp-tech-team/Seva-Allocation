Bot: 
Based on the provided data and user query for "software engineers with over 10 years of experience," we can analyze and aggregate the available information. 

### Analysis of Data
1. **Experience Calculation**: To determine the software engineers with over 10 years of experience, we use the **Work Experience/From Date** and **Work Experience/To Date** fields. If the difference between these two dates is greater than 10 years, that individual is considered for the query.

2. **Demographics**: The data includes demographics such as SP ID, Gender, and Age, though the focus is primarily on work experience and designation.

3. **Unstructured Data**: The unstructured data presented includes information on company names, designations, tasks, and skills but lacks specific structured columns that definitively denote experience in software engineering.

### Extracted Candidates
From the unstructured information provided, let's summarize the individuals who seem relevant based on their designations and tasks:

1. **SP ID 618312.0**
   - **Designation**: Application Engineer at Oracle India Pvt Ltd
   - **Tasks**: Backend software development.

2. **SP ID 614807.0**
   - **Designation**: Software Developer at American Airlines
   - **Tasks**: Not specified.

3. **SP ID 615981.0**
   - **Designation**: Associate Software Developer at HCSC
   - **Tasks**: Application deployment and fixing coding issues.

4. **SP ID 619120.0**
   - **Designation**: Practice Manager at Apps Associates
   - **Tasks**: Technical delivery of Analytics projects.

### Conclusion
From this analysis, the individuals listed above could be potential candidates based on their titles related to software engineering and their work experiences. However, we do not have confirmation on exactly how many years of experience each candidate has, besides the ones filtered out in the SQL query, which indicates that they have more than 10 years of experience. 

### Final Listing
Here is the list of software engineers inferred from the available data:
- **SP ID**: 618312, 614807, 615981, 619120.

For a precise identification of qualifications and experiences, further details or a more structured dataset may be needed.

Based on the user's query for software engineers with over 10 years of experience, the processed data did not yield any structured results indicating participants with the specified criteria ("Work Experience/From Date" and "Work Experience/To Date" with a difference of more than 10 years). 

However, unstructured data was presented, which does not provide quantitative metrics for years of experience, but does identify several individuals with relevant work experience. Below are some key points derived from the unstructured data. Unfortunately, none of the entries explicitly indicate over 10 years of experience. 

Here is a summary of the entries related to software engineering, though the experience duration is not specified:

1. **SP ID: 618312**
   - **Company:** Oracle India Pvt Ltd
   - **Designation:** Application Engineer
   - **Tasks:** Backend software development requirements
   - **Education:** Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering

2. **SP ID: 618672**
   - **Company:** Primesoft Solutions
   - **Designation:** Associate Software Engineer
   - **Tasks:** Automation QA development
   - **Education:** Master of Computer Application (M.C.A.)

3. **SP ID: 614807**
   - **Company:** American Airlines
   - **Designation:** Software Developer
   - **Education:** Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Information Technology

4. **SP ID: 615078**
   - **Company:** HCSC
   - **Designation:** Associate Software Developer
   - **Tasks:** Application deployment and bug fixing
   - **Education:** Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Computer Science

Unfortunately, all other entries either lack substantial work experience, relevant work history, or do not meet the specified criteria for a designation (many entries lack a specific designation). 

**Conclusion:** There were no software engineers identified with over 10 years of experience based on the provided data. If further details or filters can be offered to refine this search (like specific dates, companies, or durations), it may yield more accurate results.
