# GraphRAG: Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Overview

GraphRAG is an advanced question-answering system that combines the power of graph-based knowledge representation with retrieval-augmented generation. It processes input documents to create a rich knowledge graph, which is then used to enhance the retrieval and generation of answers to user queries. The system leverages natural language processing, machine learning, and graph theory to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Motivation

Traditional retrieval-augmented generation systems often struggle with maintaining context over long documents and making connections between related pieces of information. GraphRAG addresses these limitations by:

1. Representing knowledge as an interconnected graph, allowing for better preservation of relationships between concepts.
2. Enabling more intelligent traversal of information during the query process.
3. Providing a visual representation of how information is connected and accessed during the answering process.
