So, I chose this path to first get a clarity on life and on how I should feel, think, talk, respond, and be with myself, so that when I be with others or in the world outside I am a much more better person.","1. Daily Schedule - In my life, whenever I was in college hostel or stayed alone, I used to follow a schedule like waking up early, doing my practices and then going to college or work. But whenever I was at home for holidays or any other day, I am not regular in waking up early and following a schedule as I feel more relaxed there. So, I think whenever I am left alone I will give my 100 percent to follow the schedule. 
 
2. Personal Time - One thing about me, I have very few friends to whom I talk rarely. The one person to whom I share everything is my mother but I wanted to know how it would be or how will I decide if I am left alone. So I find this as an opportunity to make me rely on myself for everything that I do and think. 
 
3. No Days Off - I am working in an IT company and I always waited for the weekend but whenever weekend arrives, I simply do household chores, in my free time scroll through reels, eat, sleep and not do anything productive. Instead of spending weekends like this, I feel it would be great if it would go productive. Even though, I tell this I know that it might be difficult for me to accept this but as days go by I think I will be able to adapt to it and will even forget what day it is while being in the ashram.","1. Walking long distances - In my work, I go to office only twice a week as it is hybrid, that to in two wheeler. So I don't walk that frequently. But when I initially joined the company and was in a hostel. I used to walk a total of 4 kms in a total to go to the office and come to the hostel daily. Also during college days I used to walk 4 times from college to hostel in the morning and for lunch and in the evening. So, even though now I don't walk much, I am used to walking and I think I'll be able to do it subsequently. 
 
2. Sitting cross legged - Whenever I work from home, I sit on the floor and work. But still I'll practice sitting cross legged and in arthasidhasana for more time before I come to this program. 
 
3. Difficult Activities - I am not a person to usually do physical activities and heavy lifting, but if that is the seva I am assigned to I'll go through it and train my body to break that limitation as well.","I am willing to do the activity assigned to me. One thing about me I have not done physically intense jobs before like shifting heavy objects, working in the fields for long time and it would be difficult for me to do it initially. But as days go by I think I'll be able to adapt to that.","During my college days, I shared my room with 3 other roommates, so a total of 4. And also from the webinar I got to know that we come to the stay area only to sleep, so I think it will be fine for me to be in a dormitory stay area with a four sharing room and share bathroom facilities. I've got a experience in volunteering as I've volunteered in my local centre and also at the Ashram, so it would be fine for me to mingle with people and do things during volunteering activities.","Even though my family thought that leaving a job with salary is a difficult decision, they are satisfied that they are sending me to the right place for the betterment of my inner wellbeing. My family suggests that searching and getting a job will not be a difficult process but if I miss this chance of being in the ashram and working on myself, it would be hard for me to make this same decision again in the future.","No, I don't have any questions, mostly everything was covered in the webinar. Thank you.",yes

- I have volunteered in Linga Bhairavi Temple in Nepal last year and this year in Isha Institute of Inner-sciences in Tennessee, my body knows the significance of consecrated spaces, and feels their absence after coming back, IYC is a must-go, numerous times I have imaged myself near the presence of Dhyanalinga, I must be there 
- Timewise speaking Sadhanapada is also beautifully designed by Sadhguru, July to Mahashivratri is most beneficial for spiritual growth, besides solar flares are dancing with us these years, it couldn’t be better 
- I also wish to do Samyama in IYC 
- Sadhanas in the Abode of III felt like a breeze, but a little bit of struggle after coming back, this is the importance of good ambience for spiritual growth, I wish to strengthen my sadhanas during Sadhanapada, and learn more sadhanas if I have the chance 
- I am facing career change, fear and doubt make me hesitate to move forward, by Sadhanapada I wish to transform myself to be more joyful & disciplined & unwavering no matter what I do 
- I’ve learned that Seva & Sadhana is great combination to demolish one’s ego/karma and to be more available to grace, this is what Sadhanapada is about, it’s similar to my volunteering experience in Nepal & US but so much more intense & disciplined, and it’s exactly what I want","- as Shoonya Intensive & BSP alumni I have totally experienced isha’s way of conducting programs——fully scheduled, cut out from the outside world and fully dedicated to one’s inner growth, I understand it, endorse it, and would totally go by it 
- In BSP I was amazed by how beautifully and intelligently the program was designed——it was so conversational, it’s like Sadhguru knew what I gonna think and feel and had already prepared the next step for me, he was not there but he was totally present, Sadhanapada must be the same, beautifully designed by Sadhguru, I would totally embrace his grace without saying a word 
- again I know why Sadhanapada is designed like this and it’s totally what I what——I’d love Sadhguru pushing me towards higher possibilities","- I have just come back from 6 month volunteering in III Tennessee, did every possible seva, lots of them involves heaving lifting like gardening, warehouse, housekeeping etc., and I love them, great to stretch the body in nature, food felt so much more delicious 
- interesting fact, first two month in III my Apple Watch constantly congratulated me “you have walked longer distance!” “you have climbed more stares!” “your resting heart rate is lower than before!” , after coming back it’s constantly lamenting “your walking distance has been lower” “your total working out time has been declining”… hahaha wish to go back volunteering!!! 
- sounds like bragging again, in III other volunteers was amazed why I was always running instead of walking among locations, while, I want to save time and I love running! can’t wait to run in IYC where the whole land is consecrated 
- about sitting cross legged, after getting addicted to Sadhguru I have given away my expensive ergonomic chair and sit cross legged on the ground ever since, it’s much more scientific and comfortable way to be","- totally willing to do whatever assigned, at the Bhairavi Temple in Nepal I did everything except selling and in III did every seva except administration, no matter it’s physically intense or office based, I would do whatever needed 
- doing whatever needed is both good for myself and the ashram, good for the ashram, while ashram have lots of work to be done especially IYC takes so many social responsibilities, good for myself because by demolishing likes & dislikes, sevas could loosen our karma/ego structure and make us more available to grace","- like India, China is crowded, we have grown up in dormitory culture 
- in III Tennessee I shared the room with 6 others, very natural for me","- in the beginning they were not supportive “you are thirty something now and why are you still doing this nonsense!? you should earn more money, get married and have a son to pass down our family name!!!” 
- when I was in Nepal they were afraid of me becoming a monk…  
- gradually they see how happier and more vibrant I am after coming back from Nepal and US, now they have changed the attitude “do whatever you and to do for one more year and then get married OK?” hahaha","how early could I go there, suppose everything goes smoothly?",yes

I wanted to initiate my spiritual journey under Guru's presence who will initiate me to become a full time spiritual seeker but I was tangled up in work and family situations, currently I am 31 years old, eldest in three siblings in the family of five. Due to some legal business dispute which took too long to get resolved I was giving my full attention day and night to my work and family and being an introvert i am struggling to get directions from anywhere in regards with spirituality. Though the nearest Isha yoga center from my town which is Chhatarpur, Delhi is not too far it's around two and half hour travel (one way) on my scooter or car (traffic included), i am not able manage to go there or join any programs there even once though I had plans. And now as court matters have been resolved to the level which is manageable and business is running smoothly I will surely be able to visit Chhatarpur (Delhi) center in coming days and seek necessary guidance but being always in presence of guru during Sadhanapada will definitely accelerate things. 
Why this particular time I wanted to join Sadhanapada? It's more like now and never kind of a situation for me, As we are three of us (me, my father and my younger brother) handling our joint business which are segregated in two segments hence needing at least two members all the time to keep things going. As my father is aging (he is 61 currently) he might retire soon in coming years so i want to initiate my spiritual journey before he decides to retire. And after Sadhanapada i will continue my spiritual journey at home in full throttle with continuing supporting my immediate family. I will retire from my business as time will come on the path to become a full time sadhak/monk. (My ultimate goal is to attain moksha, atleast i want to give it my best).","For a beginner like me who is initiating a spiritual journey it’s necessary to strictly follow the rules provided by guru to keep itself available to guru at all levels all the time. 
In my understanding these rules and discipline will support my presence (attentiveness).","Due to my daily routine work which is already physically demanding for the average person. I am physically active and fit. I also practice Shambhavi Mahamudra daily which helped me shed 8 kilos and made me fittest ever. Yes, I can walk a long distance 5-6 kms barefoot daily on the ground. I sit in Ardhasiddhasana all the time and don't find any difficulty. I have never done farming, Gardening is my subject of interest. I maintain a few plants on the rooftop. I understand it is a different thing altogether. I think I might be capable of farming as well. It's a matter of opportunity for me if i get it i can do it. Considering the risk of snake bites in fields I can do it with guidance.","I will be happiest to be volunteering in the ashram, I have gone through long office hours happily (3-4 years) and intense physical work is my daily business. I have a trading and manufacturing business of metal hardwares, in this industry intense physical work is a regular thing. If i don't get much physical work i consider that day is not my happiest day, rest all are my happiest days. haha.","I lived in a hostel for about four years (2010-14), I don't find any struggle in sharing space. The good part is if there are many, they have to follow all rules of space, democracy wins.","My Mother will be saddest, i have a good connection with her though she understands my need she will be fine. My sister doesn't care, she must be happy as long as I am not at home(As I tease her all the time). My brother is fine and will respect my decision and he is more than capable of handling our family business. I already told my dad that I will be going to Sadhguru's ashram in July 2025 and the final decision will be taken by my teachers. My father called my decision stupid and told me that you are independent to take care of your needs. (Deep inside he just wants me to be happy) Also I think My family is ok in my absence as I solo travel every monsoon on mountains for 1-2 weeks, they don't get worried about me. I handle situations quite well. 
In conclusion: I am independent of taking this decision, my family is supportive and will be fine in my absence.",I don't have any query right now.,yes

",Marathi (R W S T),Intermediate,Fluent,Medium,Intermediate,,,,,,,,,,Only IE,"At this point in my life, I feel there is a part of me that remains unfulfilled. While I may be working hard, I sense that I am not operating at my full potential, or perhaps I am, but I am still not satisfied with where I am. I wish to fully own and enhance this potential, focusing my attention and energy to reach my true capabilities. I believe the Sadhanapada program will provide me with the tools and environment needed to explore this part of myself, helping me grow into a more focused and empowered version of myself.","I believe that following a strict daily schedule, having limited personal time, and adhering to the program’s expectations and ashram guidelines are essential for my inner growth. I have always wanted to adopt a structured routine, waking up early and engaging in purposeful activities. Although this schedule is more demanding than my current one, it aligns with the direction I want to take in my life. I understand it won’t be easy, but I am ready to embrace it with an open mind and a willingness to grow. I see this as an opportunity to strengthen my discipline and focus, knowing it will lead to something meaningful.","I believe the physical demands of the program, such as walking long distances, sitting cross-legged, and engaging in challenging activities like farming, are ultimately for our own physical well-being. I actually enjoy physical work, and sitting cross-legged feels natural to me, as it’s something I’ve done since childhood. While farming may be new to me, I am excited about the opportunity to learn. I’ve always had a small hobby of gardening at home, which has helped me feel connected to nature, so I don’t foresee this being an issue. In fact, I think it will be a rewarding experience.","The webinar has made it clear that it's not about seeking comfort but about fostering inner growth. With that in mind, I am fully willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activity, whether it is physically demanding or office-based, for the entire duration of the program. I understand that each task has its purpose, and I don’t want to be selective or seek comfort in what I do. My focus is on fully immersing myself in seva and embracing the experience, knowing that this is key to my personal growth.","Sharing space with many other volunteers, such as in a dormitory or shared bathroom facilities, is a bit outside my comfort zone, as I’m used to having more personal space. However, I see this as an opportunity for growth. It’s something I’d like to work on, as learning to live and collaborate with others in close quarters will be valuable for me, not only during the program but also in life. I believe this experience will help me become more adaptable and open, which is a crucial part of the journey.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full seven-month duration of the program. While they may not fully understand all the aspects of the program, they trust my decisions and believe that it is for my own good. They have always supported my personal growth and are not going to stand in the way of this important journey in my life. Their trust and support give me confidence in committing to this experience wholeheartedly.","What types of sadhanas are practiced during the seven-month program, and how do they help in reaching deeper levels of inner growth and transformation? I would like to understand how these practices contribute to my personal development and how they can help me connect more deeply with my inner self.",yes

Then I was initiated into Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya and then I went through Bhava Spandana and then I got initiated into Shoonya.  
I have now realized that I have to work on making myself receptive to Grace which is ever present rather than what I was doing before which was trying to reach somewhere. I have also realized that I need to work towards my willingness and for that I wish to go through Sadhanapada at this particular time. 
There are many ways in which I am hoping to grow through the program which includes living in a consecrated space, building willingness through volunteering into Seva, living among other Sadhaka, regularity in the practice of Kriya.","Since the program is designed by Sadhguru himself, I can see that the design looks challenging and at the same time necessary to bring the willingness in the participant that is required for their transformation. To transform myself the way the program expects, it makes sense to fully commit to the guidelines and requirements given. I see all these as necessary to create enough willingness to be ""ON"" all the time.","I feel the activities can be physically demanding but at the same time essential to learn what it takes to be involved into something. Since there is no physical ailment in me right now, I am sure I will be able to commit 100% to any physical activity in spite of how demanding it might be.",I am willing and excited to be assigned any kind of volunteering activity during the full duration of the program. I am sure I'll be able to perform any office-based activity and even the physically intense activities given I'll be in good health at that time.,I am comfortable with sharing my space with many other volunteers.,"Six years ago, I left an IT corporate job and started backpacking and then I gradually watched myself transformed into a Seeker. Initially it was difficult for my parents to understand why I am doing what I was doing, but gradually they have come to terms that they have told me to do whatever I feel is best for my life. The relationship between me and my parents is in much better health now and I am sure they don't mind me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program as long as I know that this is the best thing to do for my life.","Since the Kailash Mansarovar Sacred Walk for 2025 falls under the duration of Sadhanapada, is it possible for a participant of Sadhanapada to register for that Sacred Walk too during the Sadhanapada?",yes

","Sadhguru always says that when you're deeply involved in something meaningful, you don’t think about rest, food, or entertainment. That’s how I live—because I value my life, whatever I do, I give it my all, without distractions. 
 
","As a fitness coach, playing badminton daily and regularly practicing my sadhana is part of my routine, so it's not a big deal for me.","I'm giving my all because I see this as my last chance. Whatever is needed, I'll do my best. 
 
","I'm really happy to share these things with the volunteers because they want to live life fully, just like me. It's truly my pleasure.","MMy family saw my commitment and made plans for the next 7 months, taking care of finances and other responsibilities. That's why they Accept  to do Sadhanapada

Sadhguru said, if you are with me for one moment completely, we don't need this laptop, phone ,video , etc. I can initiate you just like that if you are ready. And I had tears flowing down my eyes continuously. I couldn't understand the emotion. I wasn't happy or sad but it was an explosion inside of me. Immediately, I requested Isha Yoga Center Coimbatore to allow me to take part in Bhava Spandana the following week on July 16th and by his grace, they did allow me, after which I immediately signed up for volunteering for BSP. Co incidentally, this was BSP for 2024 Sadhana Pada participants. I was so inspired by their energy levels. Volunteering opened up something new inside me as I had never volunteered/helped around anywhere before. Sadhguru has always surprised me and taken me for a ride and I just sit with him. I don't know how I am hoping to grow. I am someone who just jumps into things without any expectations.  I just want to do more and more sadhana and seva and dissolve into everything. ","I think its the perfect schedule. In my experience of being an Ashram Program Volunteer in the past, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not using my phone so much and reducing my words to 50% became so easy to practice, with the schedule given to me. It made me realize how much (for the lack of a better word) garbage was in my mind and activity everyday and how I was doing so many things compulsively. It made me a more conscious person. ","I am quite physically active and make sure I walk or run at least 2-3 kms a day. I have also started practicing Yogasanas, therefore, I'll be okay with everything. ","When I enrolled myself for BSP Volunteering, I definitely had some resistance towards some activities. We were taught a mantra and when I would recite it, doing anything and everything became so easy and blissful. Therefore, I am okay with any activity assigned to me. ","I studied in a Boarding School and there, it was a huge dorm of 60 people. I have already lived in spaces like that and I grew up to miss it. So, Im quite excited to be taken back to my school days! ",They are very happy and proud that I have been able to take this path with Sadhguru early in life. ,NA,yes

1. Develop clarity : After attending Samyama in December 2022, my life completely turned upside down. The experience has been too intense and mystical to even articulate. The old structure within me just crumbled. Nothing of mine remained. I became alien to myself. For the first time in my life, I didn't know what to do with my life except for the intense longing to rediscover my purpose and hasten my spiritual growth. Now I want to give my time and effort to develop  clarity and direction within myself.  
 
2. Intensify sadana :  Outside ashram, it is quite difficult to practice all sadanas regularly due to time restrictions,  lack of committed atmosphere, schedule and support. In ashram, one can immerse fully  in intense sadana because of highly energetic consecrated space, well structured schedule and support. I did intense sadana for a month during my samyama preparation and I saw immense change in terms of physical, mental, emotional and energetic aspects. If practicing intensely just for a month can give such great results, I wonder how drastic, immense and life changing, it can be if one practices intensely for 7 months!  
 
3. Consecrated space : Consecrated space can ignite one's energy system into different dimension and ultimate possibility. It helps one to lead concentrated and highly vibrant life.  
 
4. Strong foundation :  I want to first build stable platform interms of body, mind, emotions and energy to explore the ultimate spiritual possibility. I want to develop unwavering focus, discipline and dedication. I want to be able to handle both big and small tasks or challenges without getting overwhelmed or stressed out.  
 
5. Spiritual growth : I have been an intense seeker of truth from a very young age. I have had many profound questions about the universe, life and the nature of reality. I have found answers to few of my questions after coming in contact with Sadhguru but many are still unanswered. I am rigorously and consistently searching answers through the yogic science. I want to know the very source of my life and the creation at any cost. I want to mature spiritually as fast as possible and explode into the ultimate possibility of being a human.  
 
6. Joy of volunteering :  volunteering is a wonderful opportunity to offer oneself through action. Its a powerful process, where one can loosen up rigid personality structures, to become absolute willing and open to life. I want to grow beyond my limited likes and dislikes, ideas and opinions and become willing, flexible and open through selfless involvement. I want to be able to treat every action, whether it's small or big, with equal involvement and devotion. There is immense joy and satisfaction in volunteering. 
 
7. Poornanaga and bramhacharya : After samyama, I don't seem to find satisfaction and fulfillment in any of the activities concerning the outside world. A sense of incompleteness is growing within me as I try to involve more and more with the outside world. On the contrary, there is a deep sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in offering oneself as volunteer at ashram. In this two years period, I have developed a strong desire or inclination towards becoming full time volunteer and eventually may be brahmacharya. So I want to use sadanapada as a testing ground to see if it is the right thing for me.   
","Though it can be difficult at times, I am willing enough to strictly adhere to the requirements and expectations of the program. ",This is quit easy to me as I am a hardcore trekker! I do have prior experience in farming. ,"I am open, flexible and willing enough to take on any activity without bringing in personal priorities. ","This may be slightly uncomfortable for me as I tend keep my space very clean and vibrant. I do get disturbed by body odors, smell of unwashed clothes and seeing unhygienic habbits of others but I am inclusive enough to adjust. ",My family is always supportive of my decisions.,"Can I get to meet sadhguru during sadanapada?  
I have no further questions as I am confident and willing enough to adhere to the requirements and face any challenges that may come up. ",yes

Although, I have all this comfort and convenience, the urge to do something really worthwile and existentially valuable with my life is burning within me for few years now. I noticed that all this comfort and ""security"" is making me dull and creates more and more limitations/boundaries and resistance towards new things/changes in my life. For example, the thought of loosing my job causes so much anxiety and stress within me, as if there would not be any other possibilties in my life than this particular job. I realized, that I am really loosing my flexibility and agility to mold myself in different ""shapes"" as situations change. And this emptiness which all this causes in me reached a point where I clearly see/feel that it is not acceptable anymore. I am burning to explore the nature of me as a human being in its fullest depth and dimentsion and shift my focus completely inward. I am definitely determined to gain my flexibility and freedom back, which I had as a child. I don't want to live on the surface anymore and only experience deeper dimensions when I am volunteering or doing any activity with Isha. I want this profoundness and joy in my daily life. I think using Sadhanapada as tool for breaking my limitations and resistance towards unpleasant or uncomfortable life situations would make the change that I want to create.The structure that is given in the program would definitely be a huge support to keep up the motivation, enthusiasm and energy to keep going. Also having fixed times for guided Sadhana together with all participants gives a great boost to stick to the commitment to take up and of course complete the program. I'm striving to live a fullfilled, profound life which is worthwhile for myself and others around me. I am willing to commit and give myself to the process of the program and make use of everything which is given by Sadhguru and the energized space in the Ashram. I am willing to confront/overcome my gratest fears of insecurity and uncomfort of giving up my life as I know it till now and fully be present in the program for the whole duration whatever it takes. Never before in my life I felt so cristal clear that now is the time to invest in my inner growth and to do whatever is needed for it. I have the vision that I take up this path and stay for long term volunteering and become a Pournanga in the Ashram. Sadhanapada program is my first step towards this larger ""goal"" of mine.","It will challenge me a lot to stay open and accept all situations that are occuring and overcoming the resistance withing me. But also I know that if I'm willing to grow I can handle everything with joy and go through the program without struggle.  Since I am also a very structured person and following a kind of schedule in my daily life, I can apapt to the strict daily schedule and fixed times for different activities. I'm familiar with the guidelines of staying in the Ashram as I have been there already, so this is not a problem.","I am practicing Isha Yoga daily since more than 3 years now and also practice sitting in Ardhasiddasana while eating or watching TV at home, I think I am physically not bad prepared at least. Furthermore I am danicing Salsa and Batchata 4x/week for 2-4h/day which is also very intensly training the whole body. There will definitely be challenging times where my body would feel week or sth. but overall I'm quite confident that I can manage.",I trust the structure of the program designed by Sadhguru and will take up whatever activity will be given to me.,This will be my greatest challenge to be honest. But at the same time I'm willing and striving to break these limitations I have and make myself flexible to handle such situations effortlessly.,My mother will miss me of course and also needs to arrange with the new situation of not hearing from me as often as now but she is very supportive and knows how valuable this experience will be for my life.,"When will I get the reply whether I am accepted for the program or not? Since I need to quit my job in March 2025 at the latest, I would need a definit reply before that. I hope that this would be possible.",yes

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Program/Stay Expectations,Program/Stay Expectations,Committed With Experience,"✔ She was in the Ashram for two weeks in April last year, and she did the Shoonya program here. Her stay was a roller coaster. She felt high energy like can do many things in a day, and she was waking up easily, but also many things came up about past experiences, childhood, and breakups with friends; she started to question everything in her life: her job, how she wanted to live the rest of my life. That motivated her even more to seek fulfilment. 


✔ She has an excellent understanding of the program. Understand that focus shall be on herself and that she shouldn't seek company and strive to make friends. She is aware this is best tool for her to learn to be balanced and overcome limitations. 
✔ Schedule - She is a very structured person and is already following a strict daily schedule, so she doesn’t think she will have a problem with that. Also is familiar with the guidelines of staying in the Ashram. Mentioned that sometimes she struggles to get up in the morning early to do practices but she always does them. 
✔ Food – Loves food here. Usually follows a vegan diet but eats honey and ghee. She has problems digesting milk, but nothing serious. She already eats twice a day. 
✔ Seva - avoids having likes and dislikes and is willing to do any seva. 
✔ Stay – thinks it will be her greatest challenge, especially the lack of privacy and sharing rooms. She loves to have a quiet place where to be alone.

I didn't apply the following 2 years as I had a business at home and a girlfriend and got caught up with those things a little bit. However this time, I have closed the business and have no partners and so feel I can 100% be at the ashram without home on my mind. 
I am at the ashram currently and it has been nice to fully focus on being here, being here 100%. So I think this is a good time for me to do Sadhanapada when Sadhanapada will be the only thing in my life. So I'm hoping to go through the program with 100% involvement and participation","It will be nice to commit myself to the schedule, having little personal time and no days off I feel will just help you dissolve even more in the program.

Or if I should just focus on becoming an ishanga instead of Sadhanapada. But I think I would need to know some more info about being an ishanga first, and the different levels of commitment. But I'd love to at least one day conduct advanced programs for people. Whether it's supporting ishanga and the main ishanga

In terms of growth, 
i would like to become strong, agile and increase my stamina physically and would like be able to go and come down velliangiri hill without going out of breath like the local people there.

However, whenever the work stress increased, my sadhana continuity broke, also under extreme work conditions external factors again started affecting me, these cycles have happened a few times now, in past 5 years. I want to learn to keep doing my sadhana with utmost intensity even in a very busy schedule and want to be as balanced as possible under any kind of external situation.  
 
I have been in phases where the sadhana is happening beautifully and I am in complete balance, but the growth has been slow, as whenever work pressure increased, I was not able to maintain my sadhana intensity. Last MSR 2024 volunteering in security team was an eye opener, during the volunteering I was able to perform my activities, which were very challenging and new for me effortlessly, without any impact on me, the balance I felt for a few months after the MSR volunteering was what I have been looking for.","For the sadhana to intensify and for me to gain a transformative sense of balance and clarity, i think the strict daily schedule is needed, and I am confident I will be able to follow it. 
 
Since all aspects of the program schedule are designed for personal growth, it is worth sacrificing the personal time. Anyways the most important aspects of my current usage of the personal time is already covered in the schedule, like sadhana, food and seva. Minimising mobile usage is something I would love to make a habit. If possible not using it at all for entertainment. Only using it if any activity is to be performed. 
 
In my current schedule, I have office work mostly morning 9 am to evening 9 pm and weekends I do local center Volunteering activities, so no days off is perfectly fine, since it's for volunteering, whatever be the activity. 
 
Staying in the ashram for 7 to 8 months will not be a concern, My parents are independent and i am single, so there is no urgent dependencies, i have been planning for financial backup for this for last 3 years, so now I am ready with that as well.","I enjoyed the barefoot walks I did all day during the 10 days of my volunteering for 2024 MSR volunteering. Since it was in security team, we had to go for long walks for rece of the points. Only crossing the metal bridge during the afternoon sun was a challenge, rest all made me feel more fit and energetic. 
 
Even as a participant for grace of yoga in 2022 MSR, even though shuttle service was provided, i preferred and enjoyed walking barefoot to the halls. 
 
I am used to going for long treks with local Isha Meditator friends, once in 3-4 weeks. These are on an average 5 to 8 km treks.  
 
Over the years I have been able to sit more time comfortably cross legged, as of now I am able to sit around 1 hr to 1.5 hrs comfortably cross legged, I want to improve this. 
 
Since I get to work from home, during farming season many times I stay in Mangalore my hometown and volunteer wherever possible with farming activities at my familial farms. After volunteering for save soil to conduct sessions for students, I have also myself become more aware of the deep relationship between soil health and plant health, and i practice the learnings of this daily in my small but beautiful balcony gardens, would love to show some pictures of the produce. I also manage a composting setup of 30 liters in my balcony to process daily kitchen waste, this has been running successfully for last 3 years. Also have been teaching it to Isha meditator friends, some have replicated it at their home.",I am completely willing to be assigned to any activity that needs my service for the full duration of the program.,I am perfectly ok with sharing space with others. This will be a good test of my sadhana. I did not find this a concern at all during my 10 days of MSR volunteering and BSP participation as well.,"My mother has been an Isha Meditator for 6 years. So she completely knows and has experienced the benefits of the practices and programs of Isha. My parents have been to the ashram twice and they have simply loved the experience of being in the ashram. My father is a retired central government employee so my parent's financial requirements are covered. They have also seen me closely volunteering for local center for last 3 years, both have contributed also in that, so they know it's for my own growth.","Do I need to bring my laptop, in case that will be useful for any volunteering activity ?",yes

Actually i would say that my main purpose to go through sadhanapada would be to grow spiritually and break my limitations as much as possible but i also understand that i need balance for that so i think sadhanapada will be both the foundation and the boost for me to grow as a life. living in the consecrated space and doing sadhana regularly and having the guidance of sadhguru is once in a lifetime oppurtunity and iam hoping that it will bring about transformation in me such that whatever i go through after that i remain steady and pursue spiritual growth. in a way iam hoping that it will bring such a balance in me such that i remain one pointed in my goal to realise my ultimate nature and at the same time enable me to handle whatever life throws at me without stumbling or falling down. so the seva i will get to do and the oppurtunity to do sadhana in consecrated spaces will mentally,physically,emotionally and spiritually enhance me and i think no where else i will get such a huge oppurtunity as this and i hope that i will become a enhanced human in all aspects especially spirtually.","i think the strict daily schedule is very much needed to knead me and i think that is what is needed to break so many limitations and having very little personal time is perfectly alright with me, and the no days off aspect will also be a big factor in breaking my limitations because i understand that a spiritual person is on all the time and i have to become like that and staying in the beautiful ashram absolutely be a pleasant experience however long it may be","iam the sort of person who would welcome physical challenges, so walking long distances, sitting cross legged and difficult activities like farming are something i will galdy take on",iam willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activity because i think whatever activity it may be it will be a very good experience where i focus on something for 7 days a week. so i am looking forward for activity whatever type it may be,i have no problem sharing my space with others whether it is in stay area or during volunteering,i think they understand the benefits of the program and what is involved in it and it is ok for them and iam not the provider for my family so they wont be having any trouble physically ,i just want to know whether we get any sadhguru darshan,yes

At the end of 2023, I set out to try teaching Isha Hatha Yoga in Germany. However, I quickly realized that while I am someone who practice, I don’t feel the need to talk about it or encourage others to follow the same path. Additionally, I encountered resistance in the very rational German society toward what I was doing. So, teaching soon lost its purpose for me. After my return from India, not only did teaching fail to work out, but all the other activities I tried to establish to make a living independently also did not succeed. 
 
After months of struggle, I applied for my old job—a job I had promised myself never to return to before starting Hatha Yoga teacher training. That was about three months ago. For me, doors in Germany remained closed, which made me recall what Sadhguru had said when he came to the Hatha Yoga school during training. He said that if teaching didn’t work out, one should come back to the ashram. For some reason, those words stayed in my mind the whole time. 
 
When it became clear to me that returning to the ashram was my only path, I spoke with Lokendra Anna from the Hatha Yoga school and sought his advice on the best way to return as a long-term volunteer. After listening to me, he said the best option would be to do Sadhanapada. So I applied shortly after.","Sadhguru's guidelines have to be followed exactly, one-to-one, in the ashram outside of the Ashram. This is how someone who is committed should be.",I practice intense Hatha Yoga so my body is in good condition,I am fully willing to do whatever is required,It's fine; I have no problem with that,"They are informed, and I have their support",How much is the maximum time before the start of the program when I can already have a visa and come to the ashram?,yes

I want to understand myself better and find a sense of calm and clarity that isn’t easily shaken by everyday problems. 
 
Through this program, I hope to learn practices that help me manage stress, handle life’s ups and downs with a steady mind, and become a more positive, balanced person. My goal is to find a deeper purpose and inner strength that will help me live life with a sense of peace and kindness, and to share that positivity with others.","I understand that Sadhanapada has a very strict daily routine, with almost no personal time, no days off, and strict rules to follow in the ashram. I see this as a way to push myself beyond my usual habits and comfort zone. Sticking to such a routine will help me develop discipline, focus, and strength, which are things I really want to build in myself. 
I know it might be tough at first to give up personal time and follow such a structured lifestyle, but I’m ready for it. I believe this setup will help me stay focused on my inner growth without getting distracted. I’m prepared to follow the program’s rules and routines because I trust that this experience will bring about the change I’m looking for.","I understand that the program will be physically demanding with activities like walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for long periods, and even doing tasks like farming. While it might be challenging at first, I feel ready to take it on. I know that these physical activities are part of the experience, helping to build strength, endurance, and patience. Though it may be tough at times, I’m willing to push myself and adapt, as I believe these challenges will help me grow both physically and mentally. I see it as a chance to learn to handle discomfort and build resilience.","I’m fully willing to be assigned to any type of volunteering activity, whether it’s physically demanding or office-based, for the entire program. I understand that each task, whether it involves hard physical work or something more administrative, has its own value and is an important part of the experience. I’m ready to give my best, no matter the type of work assigned, as I know that this variety of tasks will help me grow, build resilience, and learn new skills. I see this as a chance to be fully involved, learn from every experience, and contribute wherever I’m needed.","I’m comfortable with the idea of sharing my space with other volunteers, including staying in a dormitory, using shared bathrooms, and working closely during volunteer activities. I believe that sharing these spaces will help me learn to adapt, become more patient, and build a sense of community. It’s a chance to connect with others on a similar journey, learn from them, and support each other. While it may require adjusting to a new level of simplicity, I see this as part of the growth process and am ready to embrace it as part of the experience.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the entire program. They understand that I’m seeking personal growth and inner transformation, and they believe that this experience will be beneficial for me. While they’ll miss having me around, they appreciate the purpose behind this journey and are encouraging me to fully commit to the program without distractions. Their support gives me confidence to dive into the experience wholeheartedly.","I have a few questions:

Emotional and mental fitness.
She felt like Something will happens and shei will be drawn in a situation like when her grandma passed away. At that time there was fear and anxiety.
To meet sadhguru.
After 7 month of sadhanapda she feels that, will change drastically and something miraculous will happen.
Schedule, volunteering and knowing new people will help bring transformation.

Overall it did not seem like her intent was fancy it was well grounded in reality. I gave her little context of program  and she was still enthusiastic.",None,,English (US) (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Fast,Fluent,,,,,,,,Communication,Poetry,Only IE,"I wish to go through Sadhanapada at this particular time because I’ve experienced profound personal transformation through my Inner Engineering program and the practice of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya over the last seven months. Having overcome fears that previously disrupted my sleep and thoughts, I now feel a renewed sense of clarity and inner peace. 
 
At 25 years old, I see this as a pivotal moment in my life where I can build a strong foundation for my future. Through Sadhanapada, I hope to deepen my spiritual practice and integrate the lessons I've learned. I want to cultivate greater mindfulness and enhance my ability to stay grounded amidst life's challenges. 
 
Being part of a community of like-minded individuals will not only provide support and encouragement but also inspire me to stay committed to my journey. This age is an important time for personal and spiritual growth, and I want to make the most of it. 
 
Ultimately, I aim to explore new dimensions of my practice, strengthen my connection to myself, and develop a more profound sense of purpose and commitment in my daily life. Sadhanapada feels like the perfect opportunity to continue this positive momentum and grow even further on my spiritual path.","I recognize that following the strict daily schedule and having very little personal time will be a significant adjustment. However, I see this structure as essential for deepening my practice and fostering discipline. While it may feel intense at times, I believe that the focused environment will help me stay committed to my goals and enhance my spiritual growth Also now i have a work schedule of almost 12 hours a day so dedication and unwavering attitude will help me focus.But i will leave all my work and come to give my 100% on my sadhana. 
Although personal time may be limited, the experiences I gain through sadhana and community involvement will be enriching and fulfilling. Ultimately, I believe this structured approach will help me cultivate a deeper connection with myself and the practices I am committed to.","I feel ready to embrace the physical demands of the program. Over the past seven months, my daily practice of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya has already helped me build a sense of discipline and inner strength. While walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and engaging in physically demanding activities like farming may be challenging, I see them as valuable opportunities to push my limits and grow both physically and mentally. 
 
I understand that these activities are an integral part of the Sadhanapada experience, designed not just to test the body but to cultivate endurance, presence, and mindfulness. I’m confident that with the right attitude and willingness to adapt, I’ll be able to meet these challenges and find joy in them as part of my spiritual journey.","I am fully willing to take on any kind of volunteering activity assigned to me, whether it is physically intense or office-based, for the full duration of the program. I understand that each task, no matter how challenging or routine, is an essential part of the overall Sadhanapada experience, contributing to my growth and the collective purpose of the program. 
 
I see these activities as opportunities to cultivate discipline, humility, and a sense of service. Whether working on the field or performing office duties, I am committed to approaching each task with dedication, mindfulness, and an open heart. I believe that engaging fully in any role assigned to me will help deepen my practice and allow me to contribute meaningfully to the community.","Having already lived away from home since the age of 19, and experienced sharing space with roommates during both your education and job, I don’t see communal living as a hindrance for me. In fact, those past experiences have likely strengthened my ability to adapt to new environments, work well with others, and maintain a sense of personal balance even in shared spaces. 
 
I’ve learned how to coexist respectfully with others, manage shared facilities, and create a comfortable living environment despite potential challenges. These experiences have prepared me to embrace the dormitory stay, shared bathrooms, and collaborative volunteering activities during Sadhanapada with ease and openness. I look forward to the sense of community that comes from living and working closely with others, knowing that it will further enrich my journey.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the Sadhanapada program. They understand that this is a significant step in my personal and spiritual growth. Over the years, they have seen the positive changes in me through my practices and how my commitment to Inner Engineering and Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya has brought more clarity, peace, and focus into my life.","At this point, I don’t have any additional questions about the program. Everything was clearly explained during the webinar, and I feel well-informed and ready for the experience. If anything does come up later, I’m confident I’ll be able to seek guidance or clarification when needed.",yes

Over the past few years, the practices have shaped me into a new individual with a better understanding of myself and life as a whole. Sadhanapada is an opportunity for me to dedicate a focused period of time at the ashram to enhance my inner growth and deepen my sadhana. I feel this is the right time for me to focus intensively towards on my spiritual growth, develop clarity and a sense of purpose through the program. Also, the chance to offer myself selflessly through 'seva' will help me understand myself more deeply and allow me to break inner limitations. This program will be a significant step toward my inner transformation and fulfilment.","I understand that following the strict daily schedule and having very little personal time is essential for the nature of the program. I view the challenge of having no days off and to adhering strictly to the program’s guidelines as a valuable opportunity for deepening my commitment to inner growth. The demanding schedule would encourage discipline and focus, pushing me beyond my comfort zone. Embracing this experience fully aligns with my choice of participating in this program for my personal and spiritual growth. I am ready to adapt to the guidelines to make the most out of this opportunity.","I am prepared for these physical demands of the Sadhanapada program. I see them as an opportunity to build physical strength, endurance and resilience. Stepping outside my comfort zone in this way will enhance my overall experience and contribute towards my inner growth and help me break personal limitations and cultivate a sense of discipline.","I have been volunteering at the regional centers and I am fully willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activity, whether physically intense or office-based, for the duration of the program. I understand that volunteering is a crucial aspect of the program and serves as a  tool for inner growth. I am open to all tasks as they will provide an opportunity for learn more about myself in the process. Engaging in different type of activities will help develop greater adaptability and understanding of self as well as others.","I have completed most of my programs from the ashram, and I feel comfortable sharing my space with other volunteers in dormitory accommodations and shared bathroom facilities.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program. As a single independent individual, earning and taking care of myself, I have the freedom to make significant life decisions. However I have still discussed my plans with my parents and they have given me their full approval, knowing how Isha Yoga has positively contributed in my life and having a confidence in my ability to make the right decisions in life.",I have no specific questions about the program at this time.

The seva involved a variety of activities, from morning cleaning in and around Dhyanlinga to attending the Guru Pooja led by Swami.   Throughout the day, I participated in guiding visitors, helping maintain the silence within the Dhyanlinga, and offering seva at the offering counter. We were responsible for maintaining the silence of the space while supporting thousands of visitors in experiencing the transformative power of Dhyanlinga. The day concluded with cleaning the Dhyanlinga. Also at Sandhyakalas there was Nada aradhana in which I also got a chance to play music bowl.  This experience allowed me to transcend physical as well as mental limitations,  in the powerful presence of Dhyanlinga.",1,Inner Engineering,,,,IE & some Isha volunteering,"Namaskaram 🙏,  
Currently I am in the last year of Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and by next year April -May,  i will complete my degree. So after this completion , I feel the most crucial thing which is needed to be happen is Sadhanapada , as sharings from Annas and Akkas in  Linga seva  gave me glimpse of what it means to be in ashram and in presence of Sadhguru. So the Only thing which I feel can really make me set right for anything and everything which can take place in this tenure of life and make best out of it is Sadhanapada . And also it can be a tool to deepen clarity.","This year I got a chance to volunteer for linga seva and it was an most influential experience, the 10 days totally changed everything about me , I was with total new sense of life . So, when I was a part of linga seva, everyday  started at early morning 4.30 am in Dhyanlinga  and it lasted till 10.30 pm with meeting with Swami. So even though being new to such schedule, it was hard to notice how's days passed . Being with Annas and Akkas made feel every task simple. So similarly with grace of Sadhguru this Sadhanapada will happen with ease . ","Even it sounds hard , but I have applied for Sadhanapada to break all limitations so this things are must . And I believe this all activities will happen with ease with Sadhgurus grace.",I would love to do any type of work as being a volunteer itself means being ready for anything which needs to be done.,"It's family-like,  as Annas and Akkas  share not only living spaces but also experiences and they guide if anything is done in a wrong way . And also they motivate  in many ways. So it's an amazing experience being with them.","Namaskaram 🙏   
Currently, my family has some concerns about me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of Sadhanapada. Their hesitation comes from the significant changes they noticed in me after I returned from Linga Seva—my eating habits, daily routine, and behavior shifted so much that they fear I may not return to the same lifestyle or even come back home. I understand that these concerns arise from their love and care, and it’s natural for them to feel this way.   
 
However, after witnessing the positive transformation in me, both my parents and some of our neighbors were inspired to take the Inner Engineering program offline. I believe that as they deepen their own practices through Shambhavi Mahamudra, they will gradually understand the immense value of Sadhanapada. Following Sadhguru’s guidance, I have also made it a point to express more love and care towards my parents, which is already fostering greater understanding and harmony.   
 
I am confident that over time they will appreciate why this program is essential for me. And if not right away, I trust that when they see the deeper transformation in me after completing Sadhanapada, their perspective will naturally shift. My focus is to remain fully involved in the process and to keep nurturing our bond with love, allowing it to dissolve any lingering concerns.","Nope , I don't have any questions. As I know what is needed to be known that Anna and Akkas will  let me know. Thank you very much 🙏

Now I am 24 years old and this is a good time for me to upgrade and transform myself to limitless possibilites.",I will adhere to the Ashram rules. To get the most out the program and transform ourselves I think we have to be in a certain way and I think this is all for our own benefit. ,"Yeah I have been there for 16 days and it is physically demanding especially at Biksha Hall but I am preparing for it. It will be difficult for few weeks but as the time passes the body also gets stronger but what I felt was I need to be really fit or else I will break easily. To go on and on I need to prepare myself but I don't have any issues with the demands, the more the use my body the lighter I feel.","I am fully ready. Even if its an activity which looks boring, I will do it willingly because when I was in the Ashram the last day I volunteered at the TV area and I thought this would be boring as I had to stand and welcome people for the whole day but that was actually surprising and really transformed me. As I said Namaskaram to all the visitors who were entering the Isha Yoga. It had so much impact on me I started looking at people like they are my family. The way the people said Namaskaram to me. That Bhakti towards another human being increased a lot. I would have said Namaskaram to almost 300 to 400 people that day, by the end of the day I was filled with love and joy. I can still feel that day. This happened only because I was willing to do it and to break all my limitations i have. By doing it willingly I gained a lot from it. So, from that day whatever I do, I do it willingly even if I don't really like or whatever it is I do it willingly so I don't struggle while doing the activity.","Again as I have been there I am totally comfortable with sharing space with others. I had no problem just that I have be responsible for my belongings. Dormitory stay area is good no problem, I am okay with the shared bathroom facilities as its kept clean. When I visited the Ashram there were many people and I had to sleep at different location and on the floor but it didn't matter to me and also I was would be dead by the end of the day so, even if i get little space I would sleep.","To be honest my family don't have much knowledge about these things they think its for old people, they were a bit scared that I'll leave everything and go. But I have convinced them and told them this is a program. They are not 100 supportive but it is fine I will convince them because last time I has applied for Sadhanapada and after the video call I asked my parents and they didn't allow me and I had to cancel but this time I will convince them 100%. They already know about the program need not to be worried much. A little change in perspective is needed but its my job to convince them that this is for my life.

As she said, these 7 months will give her the possibility to be a ‘human being’. After breaking up her long term relationship she had a question “who am I and what is my purpose in life?”, she realized that she doesn’t have any attachments and commitments so now it's a good time for SP. Also after her mother passed away it was a reminder for her to do something worthwhile in her life. She watched all the videos about Sadhanapada. She’s seeking intensity, clarity, and balance.

",None,,English (US) (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Fast,Fluent,False,90,Other,Currently on Isha yoga center LA phone team,3,Hatha Yoga program,"Hiking, Camping",Classical Dance,Kuchipudi,IE ++,"For much of my life I have gone through the steps of ""having, doing and being"". After reading ""Karma"" I have realized my path should be ""being, doing, and having."" My life to this point has been about achievements and goals - medical school, residency, fellowship, board certification, professorship, being in a ""perfect"" relationship, climbing mountains, performing in dance teams. Now that my long term relationship has ended I have started to question who and what I am in life. If I am no longer a future wife of my former partner then I started to question the other labels I have created - hiker, dancer, doctor, professor, daughter, sister. Realizing they will all too come to an end at some point in time, it leaves me with more questions than answers as to why I am here and what this life is truly about. I would like to start from the beginning and focus on ""being"" human. If I understand myself better and have a sense of fulfillment within, then my ""doing"" (interaction) with others is a natural byproduct and then the ""having"" is a natural second byproduct of that. If those ""labels"" I have created for myself (dancer, hiker, doctor, professor, etc) come to an end, then I will still be a whole person because I have focused on the ""being"" aspect. Sadhanapada would give me the dedicated and focused time to go inward and focus on ""being"", leaving the labels behind and blossoming from within. With this period of introspection I could then return to my medical school, hospital, friends/family with more joy, peace and creativity. It would in turn affect those around me - students, patients, friends/family. Life should be an expression of your happiness and not a pursuit of it. Sadhanapada will be the first step in finding my happiness within. ","I look forward to the strict daily schedule within the ashram. Having no ""days off"" means you are continually striving for something greater that will transform you. ","I enjoy long distance hiking - I summitted Kilimanjaro in December 2023 and climbed grand canyon (north rim to south rim, 25 miles in 15 hours in September 2024). I also enjoy doing weight lifting (4-5 days a week) and kuchipudi classes (once a week). I look forward to pushing my body by walking long distances, sitting cross legged and doing farming. ","Yes, I gladly accept the seva that will be assigned to me. Whether it be a desk job or physical in nature - I am open to the seva and how it will break barriers of what I thought I was capable of. ","I am used to camping, living without running water or electricity for up to a week at a time, and sharing tents (i.e. Kilimanjaro). As long as I have running water, electricity and a bed, I am a ""happy camper.""",My family was at first skeptical of the program. I have shared videos with them and have told them at any point if they do not feel comfortable I will not go. We have discussed my reasons for going and they are open to me taking this time of introspection for myself. Their numbers are in my intake form and they welcome you to reach out to them with questions or concerns. ,"To keep my medical license/board certification in the United States, I have to take a two hour exam every quarter. It is online. Would I be able to bring my lap top and dedicate two hours a quarter to complete the examination? ",yes
