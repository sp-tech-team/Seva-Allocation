Its been a while since i've realised and learnt that i'm a sensitive person . I've put limitations on myself so that i don't get affected much by people , circumstances and fear. So I‚Äôve been doing the same old safe common routine that suits me best . 
I haven't had much financial, social , parental or any kind of family dependency solely on me. But I want to take on more things in life now. I want to be responsible for more people ,causes and solutions possible. I want to do all this with absolute balance and no fear. Because I know i'm capable of doing a lot . But i'm not stretching myself enough . 
I'm 29 now, I want to go beyond just my set of family and friends. I want to make new connections confidently. 
For that I want to change myself. 
I want my mind to be at peace. I want to break free from any strong likes and dislikes that i've accumulated. I've managed to break free to an extent after Shambhavi, but I need to completely now. To accept people and situations as they are, without constantly believing in a strong sense of right or wrong judgement . 
Most importantly, I wish to be a happy and pleasant person for me and people around me , regardless of any external situations.","I used to be a professional tennis player and a trained carnatic singer. So i've always been in line with schedules and discipline since childhood. 
But the program goes a notch higher with the little personal time and away from home for a longer time than we did while playing in tournaments and camps . But all of it falls into the same category of what i'm working towards . Setting priorities straight. 
I think I could get overwhelmed initially, But i'll be able to get in tune with the rhythm of of the program in a few weeks .","I walk almost everyday evenings for about 4 kms. Sitting in ardha siddhasana has been easy for me since the beginning of getting initiated into shambhavi, but the stamina to continue to sit for a long time is something that i'm trying to improve. Being in touch with soil, sun and plants is my most favorite space to be in . This combination is the main reason for my never missing walks at KBR national park everyday . Practicing surya kriya since few months has been helping me with building strength . I am going to get initiated into yogasanas this month and angamardhana later after i'm well in tuned with yogasanas , by completing mandala . By june 2025, hatha yoga practices would hopefully help me be well prepared with the physically strenuous activities like farming at ashram.","I want to be that person who does any work , regardless of preference and skill , joyfully with complete involvement . This is one of the main reason's i am coming to sadhanapada .","I am looking forward to this. Because I think if you're person who can live and move in bare minimum, with just what is needed, , you will be able to live anywhere fearlessly regardless of any condition, without being captivated by the idea of comfort and luxury . 
I've always had a room of my own, or maybe shared for sometime with my sister . So until a situation is created where we have an opportunity to get in touch with shared spaces and different people with just required means, we can't really mould ourselves. 
Because in reality, a lot of energy is spent on where , how and whom we stay with and getting others help to clean our own space. If all these things are eradicated , I believe real necessary things will start happening .","They are supportive of it . They are all aware of my association with isha practices and volunteering work . 
Investing 7 months is a crucial decision for both me and them . But if i come out of it as a better person , there is nothing like it ,They'd be very proud and happy .","Would I be allowed to attend other programs in ashram like shoonya , samayama etc, , when i'm already a part of sadhanapadha .",yes

I have spent a lot of time in the ashram last year staying as far as Brahmaputra and the other buildings around and far even for the program. Although not more than 5 days at any point but I believe walking long distance eventually becomes a habit. I currently while doing my sadhanas can manage to sit in ardhasidhasana on the floor for around 2 hours at max, but again with practice that can increase too. I have never done farming before and that seems very exciting to me. At last, I completely understand that these activities are physically taxing but very essential for the program that as it a transformative program which along with discipline will help me with balance and clarity .",I don't really have a preference. Any seva is fine. I will willfully and happily do anything given.,I and my husband are currently staying in a shared accommodation in Canada however I understand that staying in the ashram will be a whole new experience which I am comfortable with it.

In November 2023, I had the privilege of completing the Inner Engineering program, and since then, practicing Shambhavi Mahamudra daily has not only transformed the trajectory of my life but has placed me on a completely different orbit. 
 
In addition, I am currently learning the Bhagavad Gita under the guidance of India‚Äôs top spiritual corporate trainer, Rohit Arora. This combination of spiritual practices has made me realize the importance of being guided by a Guru in order to reach a higher level of consciousness. I seek to experience sustained joy and blissfulness throughout the day, not just in fleeting moments. Through Sadhanapada, I hope to deepen my spiritual practices and integrate them into every aspect of my life, allowing for lasting inner transformation and a higher state of awareness.""","My children admire my dedication and laser focus in anything I commit to, and I view the strict daily schedule as an opportunity to further discipline myself. While I may have very little personal time, I see this as a trade-off for elevating my consciousness, which will ultimately benefit not only me but also my family and everyone around me. 
 
I understand that this is not a corporate job where days off are expected; this journey is for my own personal and spiritual growth. Adhering to the program's requirements and the ashram‚Äôs guidelines will only strengthen my resolve and deepen my experience. I am excited to embrace ashram life for the next 7 months and the transformation it will bring.""","On a lighter note, I often tell people that I‚Äôm mentally 25 and physically 67! Walking long distances shouldn't be an issue, as I already walk a minimum of 5,000 steps and up to 10,000 steps daily. I also love gardening, so farming feels like a natural extension of something I enjoy. 
 
The biggest challenge for me might be sitting cross-legged, but after inquiring, I was reassured that it will be addressed, and I‚Äôll receive guidance on how to manage it. I am confident I‚Äôll be able to adapt and meet the physical demands of the program.""","At 67, I understand my physical limitations. Intense physical activities like carrying 25 kg provision bags for extended periods may be challenging for me, but tasks of lesser intensity should be manageable. I‚Äôm equally comfortable with office-based volunteering, as I enjoy interacting with people and learning from them. It also deepens my gratitude for all the blessings in my life. 
 
I am open to either a rotational system or a single volunteering assignment‚Äîwhatever the standard operating procedure is at the Isha Centre. I am ready to contribute in whatever capacity is needed.""","Having spent 34 years in the merchant navy as a radio officer, I‚Äôve lived in the comfort of a spacious, private room with stewards at our service, experiencing the luxury side of life. However, I believe there can be a lot of fun and camaraderie in sharing a room, bathroom facilities, and volunteering activities‚Äîlike those memorable hostel scenes in movies set in engineering colleges! 
 
I am eagerly looking forward to this experience and the connections it will bring.""","""Initially, my family was hesitant, especially with my 7-month-old grandson, Aarvik, at home and my daughter and son-in-law both working. However, as they have seen my growing commitment to this journey, they are now fully supportive. They are eager for me to go to the Isha Yoga Center, believing that I will return refreshed, re-energized, and revitalized‚Äîready to share the experience and take them all to a higher level of consciousness.""",how will you be able to help me with my not being able to sitting crossed legged for prolonged duration.,yes

3 years back, when the train was about to halt, he got pushed due to crowd & he had ligament issue in his left leg. It took 1.5 years for it to heal. Due to this, he could not do SMMK. Now, he plays cricket, there is no problem with his leg or physical body.

| 1. Intensifying my own spiritual growth --> My focus in whatever I do each day is to bring balance to my system, establish clarity in my mind, being emotionally stable in whatever situation I‚Äôm in as well as becoming a more fully-fledged, intense and energetic human being. Especially after participating and volunteering for the BhavaSpandana program, I have wanted to expand my comfort zone until I break my limitations. Instead of earning a living, I work every day as a management consultant to confront myself in ever new situations with clients and being always on to enhance my awareness and to grow spiritually. Therefore, I feel a strong desire in myself to deepen my already regular Sadhana (1-2 times per day of Angamardana, Surya Shakti/Kriya, Shakti Chalana Kriya, Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya as well as 2 times per day of Shoonya) in a supportive space. While visiting the Ashram right now (12/2024), I sensed new dimensions offered by the consecrated spaces (Suryakund, Dhyanalinga, Bhairavi Devi, Naga and Adiyogi) and noticed that it had a significant impact on my Sadhana. I also felt a deep connection to the ashram in my 5 days of volunteering and I want to make this a fixed part of my daily structure and deepen my spiritual growth in the ever-changing situations to break my limitations. Becoming more robust and healthy, peaceful and joyful, loving and compassionate, blissful and ecstatic might be a consequence of the Sadhanapada program. My focus is on going through the process of cracking my Karma. 
| 2. Become a better version of myself to enhance my impact towards a sustainable economy => I work for a German management consulting firm (similar to McKinsey, BCG, Bain) with 1,400 employees. My focus is on making companies ready for Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) reporting , developing sustainability strategies integrated into the corporate strategy and establishing the corresponding ESG performance management. 
| 2.1 Become a better version of myself to acquire and deliver impactful sustainability projects => On the one hand, I want to develop high-impact solutions together with our clients so that they can transform their business models towards a sustainable economy. This means reducing their own negative impact on the environment (greenhouse gas emissions, pollution of soil, water and air, biodiversity, exploitation of workers in the value chain, bribery, etc.) as well as defining profound measures to mitigate long-term risks and to benefit from long-term opportunities. Especially our German clients should utilise sustainability knowledge, develop and implement actions and technologies as well as play a pioneering role to take action against the global impact of climate change, resource use, soil pollution and the social consequences of these and the global economic system. For my consulting activities and project acquisition, I have to be the best version of myself in order to convince and inspire clients and achieve real sustainable impact instead of just reaching project sales targets (earning a living). 
| 2.2 Become a better version of myself to be a compassionate, supportive and empowering leader => Although our management consulting firm plays a purpose-driven and proactive role in our client projects, our leadership approach is traditionally driven by financial targets, KPI measurement and incentive schemes. This leads to a lot of pressure both for senior colleagues to achieve their sales targets and tight project management as well as to work overload for junior colleagues in delivering projects. This damages the psychological security of our young colleagues, with the result that many have already resigned because they have to compromise their purpose for sustainability with economic interests of the leadership team. I therefore want to be the best version of myself in order to offer my future mentees/employees a safe space in which they can live out their sustainability ambitions, feel seen in their challenges, receive helpful support, having a clear guidance, realise their potential and develop themselves further as conscious human beings instead of turning towards being driven by their financial incentives. 
| 3 Becoming a better version of myself for my future family => My inner desire for spiritual growth (see section 1) drives me to break my own limitations from my upbringing, socialisation and previous life experiences in such a way that I can be a father to my future children who is lovingly supporting them in their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual development, so that they can become fully-fledged human beings. This includes contributing to a healthy, peaceful and joyful, loving and compassionate, blissful and ecstatic environment for my girlfriend (future wife), my children and the wider family. I want to offer my family the stability, unconditional acceptance and love they need to develop freely and flexibly and to face every situation in life with an open heart and mind and to perceive ‚Äúfailure‚Äù as a new opportunity to learn and handle life differently. In this context, I would also like to be a helpful support to my girlfriend (future wife) in all the challenges she faces as a mother and encourage and empower her to be the best version of herself in order to support the children in their development. For me, being the best version of myself also means being an example for a spiritual life and showing my children that spiritual tools can be an enrichment for their own lives. I want my children to see an authentic father with a peaceful, joyful, loving, compassionate, blissful and ecstatic face so that they can develop and realise these qualities in their own lives. 
||| To summarise my 3 ambitions: for me it is now the right time to deepen my spiritual growth and develop myself into a fully-fledged human being to intensify my qualities and taking responsibility for everything in my own life as well as being prepared for taking responsibilities for the life of others such as my future mentees/employees and my future family.","I understand following strict daily schedule, having very little personal time, no days off as well as strictly adhering to the requirements and expectations of the program along with the guidelines of staying in the ashram at first as overwhelming but in the end as a great support system. Strict daily schedule allocates the necessary time for Sadhana, seva, staying in consecrated places, 2x meals a day, Sadhguru darshan, rest at night etc. in order to align all the respective activities (for every participant). It offers isolation from the outside world in order to focus on my own Sadhana and tools given by Sadhguru. It also fosters a safe space to break out of familiar structures and tendencies that would be automatically triggered in familiar surroundings or during personal time. The strict daily schedule for 24/7 enables me to establish a continuous rhythm for an always-on state of energy and intensity. All this allows each participant the potential to make the same deep experiences within the Sadhanapada program. It also preserves the spiritual and supportive atmosphere and confidentiality of the ashram","I had consciously decided to learn Angamardana to improve my physical fitness and to have a balance from my daily office work. The intensive physical work in the Sadhanapada program helps to consciously shift attention from thoughts in the mind continuously to the body and the life process. It strengthens the awareness of consciously using the body, expanding its resilience, transcending boundaries and breaking the body's limitations. That's why I really appreciated volunteering in the garden or at Bhiksha Hallo during my stay in the ashram. This also applies to sitting cross-legged to increase flexibility in the legs and have more energy available for the upper body. The high level of physical activity in the Sadhanapada program will help to stabilise the body and mental strength, even if it is challenging.","I am willing to accept the volunteering activities as they are assigned to me, regardless of my likes and dislikes. I already try to approach every upcoming situation with an open heart and mind when volunteering at my local center or on Isha programmes as well as when working on new client projects. It is therefore my ambition in the Sadhanapada program to use the volunteering activities assigned to me to deepen my inner experience, to respond consciously to unexpected situations and to break my limitations.","While I was at the ashram, long-term volunteers showed me the dormitory accomodation for 25 people, the shared bathroom facilities and washing areas for a first impression. I also had an insight into being together with many volunteers in a small shared space while gardening, in the Bhisksha Hall and in the Bhairavi temple. I found shared dormitories in hostels for up to 20 people and shared rooms during program volunteering to be team-building after a certain adjustment period. In this context, I see the many shared spaces as an opportunity to make Sadhanapada an experience for all participants.","My girlfriend is very supportive of my desire to join the Sadhanapada program in 2025/2026. She has already completed Inner Engineering and practices Angamardana and Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya daily. From her own positive experience, she understands my desire to grow spiritually and is willing to let me go to the ashram for 7 to 9 months, including the reduction of our communication for that period of time. My father and mother also support my wish to participate in the Sadhanapada program. From their Christian background, they understand my spiritual ambitions. Even though they have no connection to yoga, spiritual growth, Sadhguru and a life in an Indian ashram, they support my path. As my parents and I have an unattached relationship, they know that as an independent child they have to let me dispose of my life freely. My closest friends support my aspiration to join the Sadhanapada program as they have noticed a very positive development in me since I completed Inner Engineering and since I have been practising Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya regularly. Even my employer supports me doing the Sadhanapada program as part of a sabbatical to foster my personal growth.","I used my time in the ashram as a cottage guest and as a volunteer in the Gardening, Dining and Linga Bhairavi temple to gain insights into the life during the 7-9 months of the Sadhanapada program and to visualise it realistically for myself instead of making naive assumptions. 
I feel a strong desire to do Sadhanapada in 2025/2026 . After being rejected in the application last year, I have volunteered a lot to deepen my experience and break na√Øve ideas of Sadhanapada. I want to do Sadhanapada in 2025/2026 and it's the right time for me. I am free of obligations (caring for relatives, property and financial commitments, etc.). I am in a stable relationship with my girlfriend, who will also cope with the 7 to 9 months distance well. I want to do Sadhanapada before planning a family and before taking the next steps in my career. Sadhanapada is a prerequisite for me to take these forward-looking decisions in my life. 
What does it take for me to get accepted?",yes

1. I have already started to go for long walks at home to accustom myself there. 
2. We generally sit at home on the floor while eating food and during sadhana so cross legged posture should not be a problem. 
3. Farming I have done only twice and that too at Ashram only in Devi seva and Linga seva.. So I felt it as a very good means to connect with Mother Earth, small insects, ants and other creatures around us. So hope it will be more fun to spend more time now with them.

First of all, awfully sorry for the late completion of this reflection form. Both emails with the link landed in my spam folder. I was just going to email the Sadhanapada support to see what the next step is when my wife suggested to check the spam folder and we noticed these email. 
 
If I would try to paint a picture about why I wish to go through Sadhanapada in one sentence, it would be: ""Because I feel a calling towards it"". 
My main goal is to break my old patterns to jump start my personal growth further. Lately, it feels to me like every year is like a loop. Most of the time, I am very focused on my practices and inner growth (because I have less distractions), but for certain periods my focus decreases. I do my practices every day, but I feel like my awareness is not the same. I would like to improve this so that my focus is on 100%, all the time, regardless of the exterior conditions and distractions. 
I have also wanted to spend an extended period of time in the Ashram since the first time I visited (Jan 2020). Starting with the Isha practices increased the quality of my life significantly, so I have amazing respect for Sadhguru, the Ashram and the volunteering work behind making all of this possible. 
Sadhanapada feels like to perfect opportunity to do so.",I like waking up early and having structure in my days. I see this as an opportunity to fully focus on the daily activities and increase my awareness.,"I am excited for them. I actually feel the need for more physical activity. I have had a active lifestyle for all my life, so I am used to it.

I see Sadhanapada as an opportunity for this. I am fully open to embrace any activity that I will be given.,"I am more than willing to share my space. I am used to it since I did this on multiple occasions in my life (for yoga programs, with team mates when I played sports, with friends, family etc.) 
I do want to mention that my wife is also applying for Sadhanapada, so if we both get accepted and if there is the possibility to do so, it would be nice to be able to share the space with her and support each other.","My family supports me fully. They have noticed the changes in my life since I started the Isha practices, 6 years ago. This actually led to my sister and father to attend Inner Engineering as well, so they have felt the benefits in person.","I think everything is very clear to me. The only questions that I would have is regarding the visa I would need, but I think this is a discussion for a later time.

Life, as it is, seems to cycle through similar experiences, and I feel ready to break free from this loop and explore a fresh perspective. This program feels like an opportunity to start anew, to immerse myself completely in a transformative experience that not only deepens my spiritual journey but also brings clarity and renewal. 
 
Volunteering has always been a dream of mine, and I see Sadhanapada as the perfect space to serve selflessly while also growing inwardly. At 30 years old, I feel this is the right time to commit to something meaningful, something that resonates with both my inner aspirations and my desire to contribute positively to the world. Through this program, I hope to cultivate discipline, gain insights, and align myself with a life of balance, purpose, and deeper connection.","I understand and accept this. These structures are designed to cultivate discipline, focus, and an immersive experience that aligns with the program's purpose. Living within the ashram's guidelines and adhering to its expectations is something I am ready for, as I see it as an essential step in shedding old patterns and embracing a more focused and purposeful way of living. I view them as opportunities to grow and to deepen my commitment.","I am actually really excited about the physical demands of the program. I see these tasks not as challenges but as opportunities to reconnect with my body, strengthen it, and enhance my physical endurance. It‚Äôs something I truly look forward to‚Äîbeing active, using my body in different ways. These physical activities will not only support my overall well-being but also help me stay present and grounded in the moment, contributing to my transformation.","I trust that whatever seva is offered to me will be exactly what I need to do, and I am ready to embrace it with an open heart. I understand that each task, no matter how challenging or different from what I know, will contribute to my growth and transformation. I am committed to serving with dedication and am confident that the experience will be valuable, whatever form it takes, without setting expectations.","I am comfortable with sharing space with other volunteers, whether in a dormitory, using shared bathroom facilities, or during group activities. I‚Äôve already experienced this during my previous visits to the ashram, and it was a positive and enriching experience.

They understand that this is an important step for my personal and spiritual growth. Having visited the ashram twice already, they have seen how deeply it has impacted me, and they are excited for me to continue this journey. While they will miss me, they fully support my decision, knowing how beneficial the experience has been and will continue to be.","I believe we have received enough information about the program, and I feel confident in what has been shared so far.

Through the Sadhanapada program, I am hoping to cultivate greater discipline in my daily life and deepen my sadhana. This program offers me the opportunity to evaluate whether I can fully dedicate myself to Sadhguru‚Äôs teachings and live in alignment with his vision. I hope to develop a stronger sense of purpose and self-awareness as I step into this new chapter of life. I feel like this program will help me assess if I am ready to fully embrace this path or if I still need to work on certain aspects of myself to be prepared for such a commitment.","I view this as a chance to fully immerse myself in the program and see if I can truly commit in the way that is expected. The strict schedule, minimal personal time, and the absence of breaks are all challenges, but I believe they are necessary for me to break through my limitations and grow. This structure will force me to confront my own resistance and discomfort, and I am ready to face that head-on. It‚Äôs not just about seeing if I can follow a routine. It‚Äôs about testing my ability to surrender completely, to give myself fully to the process, and to dedicate myself to something greater than my personal needs or comforts. I know it won‚Äôt be easy, but I‚Äôm prepared to dive in, to see if I can live up to the commitment, and to experience if this path truly aligns with who I am meant to become.","This is exactly why I‚Äôm applying to push myself beyond my comfort zone, develop discipline, and experience growth through challenging physical tasks. Walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and engaging in physically demanding activities like farming will not be easy, but I am ready to face them. I understand that every task, no matter how difficult, is part of something much larger. By committing to these physical demands, I will not only strengthen my body but also deepen my sense of purpose, knowing that I am contributing to something greater than myself. I‚Äôm ready to surrender to the discomfort, because I know it‚Äôs essential for my transformation and growth.","I‚Äôm fully willing to take on any volunteering activity, whether it‚Äôs physically intense or office-based. I understand that both types of tasks contribute to the overall functioning of the program and are part of the commitment I am making. I am open to stepping outside of my preferences and comfort zones, knowing that every task, no matter its nature, serves a greater purpose. I am ready to give my best to whatever is needed, for the full duration of the program, as I know this will challenge me, teach me, and help me grow in ways I cannot foresee.","I‚Äôm comfortable with the idea of sharing space because I understand that we‚Äôre there for a shared purpose. The limited personal space and shared facilities may be an adjustment, but I‚Äôm prepared to let go of any expectations around comfort. Being in a communal environment will help me focus on the larger goal and remind me that the purpose of the program is bigger than individual preferences. I‚Äôm ready to contribute positively, maintain respect for others, and accept that these challenges are part of the growth process. I feel that embracing this lifestyle will deepen my experience and allow me to stay focused on the program‚Äôs true objectives.",My family is fully supportive.,I don‚Äôt have any further questions at this time as the information provided has been clear and sufficient for me to understand the program.,yes

Another challenge I face is self-care, as I lack the discipline to prioritize my health, despite understanding its importance. Through this program, I aim to develop the discipline to make my health a top priority, gain clarity in my thoughts and overall emotional balance within me , and determine the right path for my life, ultimately growing into a better version of myself.","I feel a bit scared and nervous, wondering if I‚Äôll be able to complete this journey. At the same time, I realize that I‚Äôve been in my comfort zone for too long, and it‚Äôs time to step out, learn, and grow. I see this program as a challenge and an opportunity to transform myself. While the intensity of the schedule and the unfamiliar environment make me apprehensive, I am confident that with determination and the support of the program's structure and community, I can rise to the occasion. I look forward to cultivating discipline, building resilience, and discovering my true potential through Sadhanapada","I am comfortable with the physical demands of the program, including walking long distances, sitting cross-legged, and engaging in activities like farming. I am open to learning and adapting if I encounter something unfamiliar. Knowing these requirements in advance is helpful, as it allows me to prepare myself mentally and physically for such an environment. I understand that these activities are not only about physical effort but also about developing endurance, focus, and a deeper connection with the work at hand. I am eager to embrace these challenges as part of my growth journey in Sadhanapada","I am open to being assigned to any kind of volunteering activity, whether physically intense or office-based, for the full duration of the program. I do not perceive any task as higher or lower, as long as I can contribute meaningfully and be of service. I am ready to approach every task with sincerity and dedication.","Growing up, I have always shared my space with siblings, family, friends, and now my husband, so I am accustomed to shared living arrangements. I also understand the limitations and challenges that come with shared spaces, such as dormitories and bathrooms. I am prepared to follow all rules and regulations to ensure a harmonious environment. 
 
Additionally, I see this as an opportunity to cultivate patience, adaptability, and mutual respect, which are essential for community living. Sharing space during volunteering activities can foster a sense of teamwork and collective purpose, allowing me to grow personally while contributing to the larger goals of Sadhanapada","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program. They understand my intention to grow personally and spiritually through this experience and believe it will have a positive impact on my life. While they will miss my presence, they are encouraging and see this as a valuable opportunity for my overall well-being and grow","I am curious about the different yoga practices I will be learning throughout the program. Having completed just Inner Engineering, I understand that each participant may have varying levels of experience with different practices. I would like to know how the practice sessions are structured and what additional practices will be introduced during Sadhanapad.",yes

There has been consistent realisation that external pursuit is not going to fulfill me, no matter how noble and glorious it is. There's a certain obsession within me to take my perception of life and beyond to the next level that's on within me day and night long. I know I want to dedicate some good time exclusively for that and Sadhanapada is exactly that tool for me.","Well, it's certainly a bit challenging for anyone as we are used to have a different schedule altogether while going for.office and then having weekends off. Here, there's no such thing. I have been slowly building my schedule that helps me get early and avoid snacking and afternoon meal. Also simple things like doing my office work with greater sense of involvement and spending time with people around me with a sense of inclusion - I am trying to practising those gradually.","I think I am young and quite fit to carry these activities. I always had quite an active physical life since childhood with sports and treks, so with the right kind of sadhana, I think I can adapt to this slowly.","I won't mind at all since I came upon this realisation from my last year trial is that if I am just able to get things done with involvement and joy, my Sadhanapada tenure is a success. But if given a preference over certain activities, then yes I will not lose the chance either since Isha might find certain skillset within me that is suitable for that volunteering activity","I have shared space in my college dorms and even now in PG at Bangalore or in my small house at Mumbai. So I don't think that would be much issue. Anyways I have experienced that we get to stay in our mostly for our rest and sleep, and rest of the time we are away either for our seva or sadhana.

No days off is a first for me, this will definitely force me to live every moment since there's no separate time for that. I feel the requirements, expectations and guidelines are fair and can be adhered to strictly. Wishing that the regular sadhana will help me cope up with the changes and I can start preparing for the same. I have also experienced similar schedules when volunteering at Sadhguru Sannidhi although that is for a short period.","I have lived in large campuses during my academics where it was required to walk kms just to get to one class then to the other following a fixed shedule.

I am already used to office based work for 5-6 days in a week. The challenge for me will be working on the same task without breaks or weekend offs, but I should be able to adjust to that over time.

He has touched my life in ways I am very grateful for. During my stay, I developed a special friendship with some Sadhanapada participants and they would tell me how transformed their lives were because of the program. They would get emotional as their days in the ashram were numbered and they encouraged me to apply for the program. By then, I had already made up my mind that after my PhD was over, I would apply. My PhD is at its final stage now. Besides the encouragement from them, I have always wanted to stay in the ashram and lead the life of a spiritual seeker doing my sadhana and also offering seva. My share of suffering in life has led me to the path of spirituality. I am very blessed to exist in the same time as Sadhguru, listening to him has brought me such calmness and confidence. It felt like he was the only person who understood me, and I also understood him so effortlessly. Through Sadhanapada, I wish to grow spiritually as an individual and also grow as part of a community through seva.

‚úî She wants to go deeper and enhance her experience, also wants to have more clarity, be more conscious and more energetic.

‚úî She wants a new perspective of life, she feels the sooner she does it the better. She wants to be in the driving seat of her life.

‚úî Now is a good time for her, the fellowship program she is doing will end in May 2025 and before starting a new job, she wants to do Sadhanapada.",None,,Hindi / ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (R W S T),Intermediate,Intermediate,Medium,Intermediate,,,,,,,,Sports,Tennis,IE ++,"I wish to go through the Sadhanapada program as I have seen the tremendous benefits of yoga and meditation and want to further enhance my experience. Growing up, I wanted to be a professional tennis player and thus started doing yoga when I was 13 years old for its physical benefits. However, I quickly realized that yoga was not only helping my body but also my mind. I felt more calm, centered and focused on the tennis court and there was a notable improvement in my performance as well. 
 
When I was 15, I started to struggle with anxiety but instead of turning to medication, I began doing even more breathing and yoga. Not only did the yoga help me overcome the anxiety, but I noticed that the deeper I went into my practices, the more the quality of my life improved. I started following Sadhguru and doing Isha practices in the summer of 2020 and now having done Inner Engineering, Bhava Spandana, and Hatha Yoga, I see a world of difference in myself. I am much more conscious, focused, grateful, and joyful and am keen to enhance my experience even further at the ashram. 
 
In terms of the timing, I actually applied and was accepted for Sadhanapada starting in July 2023, which was just after I graduated from university. However, I was also selected for a highly competitive two year fellowship program at the United States Department of Treasury in Washington D.C. and was not able to postpone the start date. It was a tough decision but I ultimately decided to do the Treasury fellowship as it was a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the highest levels of government straight out of college. The fellowship program has a two year limit so it was always my intention to apply for Sadhanapada again once my time was up. 
 
If I am accepted, I feel that it would be a good time for me to go through Sadhanapada. I have been working for close to a year and a half at this point and I am thus able to see what my limitations are and I want to overcome them. By the end of the Sadhanapada, I hope to be less compulsive, more energetic, have greater clarity of thought, and feel more comfortable with myself. The prospect of deepening my current practices, learning new practices and volunteering everyday intuitively feels like the right next step for me.","I think that whilst it may initially be challenging to adjust to the requirements and expectations of the program, I will eventually get used to it. As I mentioned above, I wanted to be a professional tennis player growing up and represented the South African junior team in international competitions. My desire to improve and passion for the sport motivated me to start living a highly disciplined life as a teenager. I trained for 4-5 hours a day whilst continuing to study hard and keep up good grades at school. 
 
During my time at university and now as a working adult, I have continued to live a disciplined life as I have seen its immense benefits and the happiness that it gives me. I am conscious about what I eat, I am highly focused continuously trying to improve at my job, and I do my yoga practices everyday, no matter what is happening around me. Overall, whilst it might take some time to adjust to the strict schedule and rules of ashram, I think that I will be able to adapt as I have been in similarly intense environments before and understand that it is what is needed to break one‚Äôs limitations. I know that if I am able to go through a program as intense as Sadhanapada, it will make me feel more capable of handling anything that may come up in my life.","I am comfortable with the physical demands of the program. Even though I am no longer pursuing tennis professionally, I am still very active. I bike, run, swim, walk, lift weights and do hatha yoga on a weekly basis as well as continue to play tennis recreationally. I really enjoy being active and find that it helps both my body and my mind.","I am happy to be assigned with any kind of volunteering activity for the full duration of the program. Due to my experience with tennis and the active lifestyle that I lead, I am comfortable with physically intense activities. I am also comfortable with extended periods of office work as that is essentially what I do now. I am at the office for between 8-10 hours a day during the week.","I am happy to share my space with many other volunteers and have had the experience many times before. I always shared a room with my teammates when I travelled for tennis and I lived in a shared dorm for my first two years of university and in a shared apartment for the remainder of the time. I have never had issues with my roommates and the only hesitation that I have ever had about sharing is not having a private space to do my yoga practices. Obviously, this will not be a problem at Isha!",My family is supportive of me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program. My father is an Isha meditator and he was actually the first person that suggested Sadhanapada to me. The rest of my family are also supportive as they have seen how much yoga has benefitted me and also helped improve my relationship others. They are all proud of me for wanting to take this next step and are motivated to do some Isha programs themselves.,"If I am accepted into the program and it starts at the beginning of July, when would it be recommended that I arrive at the Center?",yes

One important thing i wish to go sadhanapada is, breaking my psychological and physiological limitations through various activities and disciplined Sadhana from a consecrated space in a period of time, I hope if i can complete sadhanapada in this age (26) and this important time to use the maximum benefits of sun energy to break my limitations and getting a well balanced body, mind,emotion, for getting clarity for doing such significant things in my life with sadhgurus grace and blessing. 
And especially the concerted space can help to focus on my spiritual growth from daily life stuffs. 
I didn't break my Sadhana from my initiation to till now and im trying my best to improve my self,..... But most of the time i failed to create the expected results Becouse of my lethargic mind and various life situation created my own karma. So i hope sadhanapada can give enough compatition for getting the clarity to go beyond my psychological and physiological limitations. 
And most importantly I have less communication skills to talk with people and understanding them, 
So i hope during sadhanapada i can communicate with several people without emotional attachment or specific aim. 
Most importantly i don't want to stuck with this lifestyles and i want to create a joyful and peaceful atmosphere within myself and the world around me. 
I felt like my more than 4.30 hours of daily Sadhana need little more attention and clarity to do that in its maximum perfection, now i can't maintain a specific time to start my Sadhana because of my unbalanced life situation so i hope sadhanapada can give significant help to getting a well balanced atmosphere in myself to do my sdhana in its maximum perfection.

She hasn't seen a doctor for that yet.,Tamil (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Slow,Fluent,FALSE,2,Other,Part of the Dining team for Guru Purnima 2024,10,"Calling, Yoga Veera, ashram support, Anand Alai",None,,,IE & some Isha volunteering,"First of all, I thought of participating in this program after completing my college but I got placed in a company and then I thought of getting work experience for at least 2 years, but I constantly kept thinking of what do I do next in my life. So, I chose this path to first get a clarity on life and on how I should feel, think, talk, respond, and be with myself, so that when I be with others or in the world outside I am a much more better person.","1. Daily Schedule - In my life, whenever I was in college hostel or stayed alone, I used to follow a schedule like waking up early, doing my practices and then going to college or work. But whenever I was at home for holidays or any other day, I am not regular in waking up early and following a schedule as I feel more relaxed there. So, I think whenever I am left alone I will give my 100 percent to follow the schedule. 
 
2. Personal Time - One thing about me, I have very few friends to whom I talk rarely. The one person to whom I share everything is my mother but I wanted to know how it would be or how will I decide if I am left alone. So I find this as an opportunity to make me rely on myself for everything that I do and think. 
 
3. No Days Off - I am working in an IT company and I always waited for the weekend but whenever weekend arrives, I simply do household chores, in my free time scroll through reels, eat, sleep and not do anything productive. Instead of spending weekends like this, I feel it would be great if it would go productive. Even though, I tell this I know that it might be difficult for me to accept this but as days go by I think I will be able to adapt to it and will even forget what day it is while being in the ashram.","1. Walking long distances - In my work, I go to office only twice a week as it is hybrid, that to in two wheeler. So I don't walk that frequently. But when I initially joined the company and was in a hostel. I used to walk a total of 4 kms in a total to go to the office and come to the hostel daily. Also during college days I used to walk 4 times from college to hostel in the morning and for lunch and in the evening. So, even though now I don't walk much, I am used to walking and I think I'll be able to do it subsequently. 
 
2. Sitting cross legged - Whenever I work from home, I sit on the floor and work. But still I'll practice sitting cross legged and in arthasidhasana for more time before I come to this program. 
 
3. Difficult Activities - I am not a person to usually do physical activities and heavy lifting, but if that is the seva I am assigned to I'll go through it and train my body to break that limitation as well.","I am willing to do the activity assigned to me. One thing about me I have not done physically intense jobs before like shifting heavy objects, working in the fields for long time and it would be difficult for me to do it initially. But as days go by I think I'll be able to adapt to that.","During my college days, I shared my room with 3 other roommates, so a total of 4. And also from the webinar I got to know that we come to the stay area only to sleep, so I think it will be fine for me to be in a dormitory stay area with a four sharing room and share bathroom facilities. I've got a experience in volunteering as I've volunteered in my local centre and also at the Ashram, so it would be fine for me to mingle with people and do things during volunteering activities.","Even though my family thought that leaving a job with salary is a difficult decision, they are satisfied that they are sending me to the right place for the betterment of my inner wellbeing. My family suggests that searching and getting a job will not be a difficult process but if I miss this chance of being in the ashram and working on myself, it would be hard for me to make this same decision again in the future.","No, I don't have any questions, mostly everything was covered in the webinar.

We have gotten so comfortable and unconscious about many things. We have become lethargic and causing harm to ourselves in many ways.

In other words, every Monday through Saturday, I‚Äôm waking up at 3:00 AM. During the morning shift, my primary responsibilities are lifting, loading, and sorting. Ever since my third day of hire, a constant factor on this job is lifting/carrying packages of different shapes, sizes, and inner contents each weighing varyingly from as light as a sheet of paper to items as heavy as the combined weight of three well-fed, large dogs. Furthermore, in addition to loading (or unloading) these items onto (or from) the tight spaces of various types of delivery vehicles, as a package handler, we are responsible for scanning, sorting, and physically arranging packages by their respective destinations.

Already, I am thirty minutes closer to my grave since I started contemplating and articulating my reason as to why I wish to go through Sadhanapada at this particular time. And in the moments I am aware of this moment-to-moment truth ‚Äîthat I am mortal and one day I will end‚Äî the mind looks at the activities I have done, the activities I want to do, and the activities I am doing and wonders, ‚ÄúAm I using this Energy, that has been allocated to me, sensibly?‚Äù For me, to determine whether this Energy is being used sensibly, one has to first set a direction. My direction is Sadhguru, my direction is Life, my direction is to allow this piece of Life to radiate and begin to experience Life beyond the limitations I am aware of and currently beholden to. In other words, my direction is to clean out and empty all the nonsense/untruth that I have built up so that I can finally be. In this effort, spending dedicated time going through this blessed, seven-month opportunity to weave a pressure-cooked cocoon from the sutras of a Living Master is the way I would like to make use of the Energy given to me.","Back in Spring of 2022, I was a participant in the Men‚Äôs 21 Day Sadhana Program at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences in Tennessee with about 20-30 other participants. Our schedule during those 21 days, was waking up by 4:30am at the latest, starting guru pooja at 5:30am sharp, chanting the maha mantra, doing group guided sadhana until about 9am, and several other structured activities for that respective day. There were no days off, I adhered to the set schedule absolutely, and happily died into the bed at around 10 or 11pm. The program was intense, in fact, a person who travelled on the same shuttle as me to attend this program, decided to leave the program about 7-11 days in because he was unwilling to flow with the rules of the situation created by the 21-day program. In all honesty, I did not realize how intense the program was until after he left. In other words, after he left my experience of the program changed in a subtle but powerful way. I do not even think I was aware at that time how my experience of the program shifted, but I could feel there was a shift. However, when I look back to those moments after that individual left and how I was after, I can see that my willingness in going through various aspects of the program was the primary factor that produced immeasurable yet significant impacts on my profoundness of experience. So one could say I had a taste of Sadhanapada. However, I say ‚Äútaste‚Äù very generously here because despite some of the surface level similarities, I really do not know what to expect out of Sadhanapada other than the fact that nature of program will be even more intense than what I could imagine, as one could infer from the focused length of the program, let alone the latitudinal and geographical location, the number of people, and many more factors. So long answer short, I‚Äôm looking forward to adhering to the strict schedule for a dedicated, consistent period of time to bring about a sustainably resilient inner foundation for alignment and balance to flower on all levels of this body.","If there‚Äôs one thing that I understand about this body it is this, the body adapts to the situations you place it in. So, while I don‚Äôt necessarily have an immediate simulation for activities like farming, I have been increasing my fitness level outside of work by doing jump rope and walking more. Once I manage to work Angamardhana into my yogic sadhana schedule and establish a mandala with the process, I‚Äôm sure I will be better able to go through a larger variety of physical demands with ease. I have already noticed some of the subtle ways Yoga Namaskar, Surya Kriya, and Yogasanas have been improving my physical culture in terms of flexibility, joint strength, spine health, and coordination. Regarding sitting crossed legged, I will continue eating vegetarian, cut out dairy for a while and sit in ardhasiddhasana as much as possible. Back in 2022, when I had volunteered at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences in Tennessee after the Men‚Äôs 21 Day Sadhana program, while it was at times challenging, I enjoyed the process of being fully involved in whatever activity I was assigned to. And in the nights, I would sleep like a rock hahaha! I can tell from the myriad of YouTube videos, Sadhanapada participant sharings ‚Äîboth in-person and online‚Äî, and even just from the webinar alone that the physical demands of the Sadhanapada program will be cranked up to a higher pitch of intensity than probably all of my experiences of volunteering for Isha Foundation in the United States combined; regardless, I‚Äôm looking forward to wholly go through this process. My preparation is on.","I read this question as, ‚ÄúHow willing are you to experience Sadhanapada?‚Äù The answer is ‚ÄúYes and yes!‚Äù Or, on a scale of 1-10, I am a TEN. One (1) being ‚ÄúI have seva preferences, and I‚Äôll only be fully involved if I get the seva I like or I expect to get.‚Äù And ten (10) being ‚ÄúWhile I don‚Äôt know why I was selected for this seva for this duration of the program, I do know that this seva provides me the best opportunity to grow in this moment as long as I give myself as totally as I can. In other words, I am willing. Wherever I am placed will be the right place for me at that time.","I‚Äôm used to sharing my living space with others, at home, when I attended both high school and university, when I attended residential Isha programs in the United States and India, and when I volunteered for Isha residential programs in the United States. I feel fine about it, I‚Äôm thankful that the residential spaces are there for us to inhabit and support us for the time we will be there.","Before I started this application, I let my immediate family know of my plans to attend Sadhanapada 2025, where I would be residing in Southern India for a minimum period of eight months starting from June of next year. I can only be thankful to them and their willingness to support my efforts in this direction. In fact, you may have seen that I watched the webinar twice. That second time, I watched it with my mum and cousin sister. Furthermore, my family knows that I am well aware of our current financial situation, and that I am actively settling that aspect so that by time May 2025 comes around, the path forward will be more easily walkable. They also have increasingly become aware that since my first Isha program in 2021, that I have made Isha a priority of my life more and more. Furthermore, they have been supportive in my growth all my life in several ways I have been aware of, in several ways I am becoming aware of, and in innumerable ways that I have yet to be aware of. Without their nurture, I would not be where I am today, let alone being aware of a program or even organization of such magnitude. For my mum, even though she is not necessarily an Isha meditator, she‚Äôs the one who introduced me to Sadhguru back in the winter of 2020. For my dad, even though he is not an Isha meditator at all, he‚Äôs always stated to me these two things since I was maybe 10 or 11 years of age: (1) ‚ÄúAs your father and mother, we are your cheerleaders. We want the best for you, so you must always strive to be your best.‚Äù And (2) ‚ÄúThe ball is in your court. It‚Äôs up to you whether you dribble, pass, juggle, shoot, or launch it. That choice is always in your hands. You are the captain of your ship.‚Äù For my cousin sister, she has always wanted to make sure that I am acting and moving forward sensibly, and she would advise accordingly. So long answer short, my family is supportive of me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program.",I can‚Äôt think of any outside of the ones you have sufficiently answered.,yes

This psychology research lab is located in the Beckman Institute, which is in the northern area of the UIUC campus. As a research assistant, I collaborated weekly amongst a team of nine to eleven individuals about ongoing lab projects. My other responsibilities included, testing various older participants‚Äô cognitive abilities using a rigorous neuropsychological battery, utilizing an analysis method called the Kintsch text-protocol system to analyze over 70 subjects‚Äô data, which allowed us to submit our abstract proposal for the 2020 Cognitive Aging Conference at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and lastly (but most importantly) I maintained positive relationships with lab participants by resolving issues and attending to their needs both over the phone and in person.",Research and Development,2018-12-10,2021-11-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More specifically, as a WSA, I was staffed at the front entrances of classroom buildings to check an individual‚Äôs building access status. One's building access status was displayed through an app called Safer Illinois (at the time) and it showed us --the WSA's-- whether the individual had been vaccinated and currently COVID negative or positive. During that role, I greeted and provided a warm experience to faculty, students, staff, and all who entered the buildings I was stationed at regardless of their building access status. Furthermore, I was trained to resolve, de-escalate, and guide individuals with restricted building access in a timely manner by following the established guidelines of the University of Illinois Campus Security Training.",Defence Jobs,2020-09-07,2021-11-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- I have volunteered in Linga Bhairavi Temple in Nepal last year and this year in Isha Institute of Inner-sciences in Tennessee, my body knows the significance of consecrated spaces, and feels their absence after coming back, IYC is a must-go, numerous times I have imaged myself near the presence of Dhyanalinga, I must be there 
- Timewise speaking Sadhanapada is also beautifully designed by Sadhguru, July to Mahashivratri is most beneficial for spiritual growth, besides solar flares are dancing with us these years, it couldn‚Äôt be better 
- I also wish to do Samyama in IYC 
- Sadhanas in the Abode of III felt like a breeze, but a little bit of struggle after coming back, this is the importance of good ambience for spiritual growth, I wish to strengthen my sadhanas during Sadhanapada, and learn more sadhanas if I have the chance 
- I am facing career change, fear and doubt make me hesitate to move forward, by Sadhanapada I wish to transform myself to be more joyful & disciplined & unwavering no matter what I do 
- I‚Äôve learned that Seva & Sadhana is great combination to demolish one‚Äôs ego/karma and to be more available to grace, this is what Sadhanapada is about, it‚Äôs similar to my volunteering experience in Nepal & US but so much more intense & disciplined, and it‚Äôs exactly what I want","- as Shoonya Intensive & BSP alumni I have totally experienced isha‚Äôs way of conducting programs‚Äî‚Äîfully scheduled, cut out from the outside world and fully dedicated to one‚Äôs inner growth, I understand it, endorse it, and would totally go by it 
- In BSP I was amazed by how beautifully and intelligently the program was designed‚Äî‚Äîit was so conversational, it‚Äôs like Sadhguru knew what I gonna think and feel and had already prepared the next step for me, he was not there but he was totally present, Sadhanapada must be the same, beautifully designed by Sadhguru, I would totally embrace his grace without saying a word 
- again I know why Sadhanapada is designed like this and it‚Äôs totally what I what‚Äî‚ÄîI‚Äôd love Sadhguru pushing me towards higher possibilities","- I have just come back from 6 month volunteering in III Tennessee, did every possible seva, lots of them involves heaving lifting like gardening, warehouse, housekeeping etc., and I love them, great to stretch the body in nature, food felt so much more delicious 
- interesting fact, first two month in III my Apple Watch constantly congratulated me ‚Äúyou have walked longer distance!‚Äù ‚Äúyou have climbed more stares!‚Äù ‚Äúyour resting heart rate is lower than before!‚Äù , after coming back it‚Äôs constantly lamenting ‚Äúyour walking distance has been lower‚Äù ‚Äúyour total working out time has been declining‚Äù‚Ä¶ hahaha wish to go back volunteering!!! 
- sounds like bragging again, in III other volunteers was amazed why I was always running instead of walking among locations, while, I want to save time and I love running! can‚Äôt wait to run in IYC where the whole land is consecrated 
- about sitting cross legged, after getting addicted to Sadhguru I have given away my expensive ergonomic chair and sit cross legged on the ground ever since, it‚Äôs much more scientific and comfortable way to be","- totally willing to do whatever assigned, at the Bhairavi Temple in Nepal I did everything except selling and in III did every seva except administration, no matter it‚Äôs physically intense or office based, I would do whatever needed 
- doing whatever needed is both good for myself and the ashram, good for the ashram, while ashram have lots of work to be done especially IYC takes so many social responsibilities, good for myself because by demolishing likes & dislikes, sevas could loosen our karma/ego structure and make us more available to grace","- like India, China is crowded, we have grown up in dormitory culture 
- in III Tennessee I shared the room with 6 others, very natural for me","- in the beginning they were not supportive ‚Äúyou are thirty something now and why are you still doing this nonsense!? you should earn more money, get married and have a son to pass down our family name!!!‚Äù 
- when I was in Nepal they were afraid of me becoming a monk‚Ä¶ 
- gradually they see how happier and more vibrant I am after coming back from Nepal and US, now they have changed the attitude ‚Äúdo whatever you and to do for one more year and then get married OK?‚Äù hahaha","how early could I go there, suppose everything goes smoothly?",yes

I am no longer easily carried away by thoughts and emotions, and I feel more at peace and joyful. This change has made life feel entirely different, and yet I realize how little I truly know about life. I am eager to experience more at the Isha Yoga Center while I am in good physical and financial health. Therefore, I am very keen to go through the Sadhanapada program to experience more of the unknown and the possibilities it offers. 
I hope that through various events in the program, I can fully dedicate myself and let go of my ego, surrendering entirely to life and allowing life to be life itself.","Initially, I thought it might be exhausting, and I might feel a desire to resist or escape. However, my perspective changed completely after volunteering for the Shoonya program in Hong Kong this August. During the Shoonya volunteering, I only slept 2-3 hours each day, continuously engaged in various tasks and responsibilities, with no personal time whatsoever. Through this complete immersion, my body adapted from initial fatigue to a state of lightness and ease. I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and operated at an efficiency I had never experienced before, which was both entirely new and profoundly beautiful. By the end of the course, I felt reluctant to leave. 
Therefore, I look forward to experiencing this beauty again through the intensity of the Sadhanapada program.","As someone who usually spends long hours in an office, any activity away from the office makes me happy. :) 
I grew up in a rural area in China and have experience with farming. In my daily life, I also keep up with regular Hatha practice and long walks, so I feel I can handle the physical demands of the program.",I am 100% willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activity. Any kind of activity is okay with me.,"I have always shared rental spaces with others, so sharing common areas with others is not a problem for me.","They believe that as long as I can take responsibility for my choices, they are supportive.

I recently attended the BSP program at Isha Institute of Inner Sciences. During my time there, I had such clarity and courage to make decisions that aligned with who I was, that it was incredible. After coming home, my old habits of being influenced by external factors (like other's opinions & wishes, monetary concerns, etc.) started to reappear again. I want to deepen my practices and my sadhana so I can continue to live with a clear and conscious mind, allowing me to make the best decisions towards achieving the goal of helping others become more conscious and willing to live and be involved. 
I believe this is the perfect time for me since I budgeted myself two years of self-exploration after quitting my job. One year has already passed and it has helped me realize I need to learn how to consciously stand up for the life inside me instead of unconsciously living in autopilot or trying to appease others. Thus, I want to take the next step of becoming a ""full-fledged"" human being and I think this would be the best possible option.","I'm willing to do so. I think it will help me to shed my ""identifications"" and just enjoy the process of being part of something greater.","I believe for the walking part I will be fine.

So he feels ""now"" is the best time for him to come.",None,,Hindi / ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Fast,Fluent,,,,,,,,,,,"I wanted to initiate and fulfill my spiritual needs with full involvement and devotion since after completion of 2019 free inner-engineering program offered during Diwali (I have completed inner-engineering again recently in march 2024.) I wanted to initiate my spiritual journey under Guru's presence who will initiate me to become a full time spiritual seeker but I was tangled up in work and family situations, currently I am 31 years old, eldest in three siblings in the family of five. Due to some legal business dispute which took too long to get resolved I was giving my full attention day and night to my work and family and being an introvert i am struggling to get directions from anywhere in regards with spirituality. Though the nearest Isha yoga center from my town which is Chhatarpur, Delhi is not too far it's around two and half hour travel (one way) on my scooter or car (traffic included), i am not able manage to go there or join any programs there even once though I had plans. And now as court matters have been resolved to the level which is manageable and business is running smoothly I will surely be able to visit Chhatarpur (Delhi) center in coming days and seek necessary guidance but being always in presence of guru during Sadhanapada will definitely accelerate things. 
Why this particular time I wanted to join Sadhanapada? It's more like now and never kind of a situation for me, As we are three of us (me, my father and my younger brother) handling our joint business which are segregated in two segments hence needing at least two members all the time to keep things going. As my father is aging (he is 61 currently) he might retire soon in coming years so i want to initiate my spiritual journey before he decides to retire. And after Sadhanapada i will continue my spiritual journey at home in full throttle with continuing supporting my immediate family. I will retire from my business as time will come on the path to become a full time sadhak/monk. (My ultimate goal is to attain moksha, atleast i want to give it my best).","For a beginner like me who is initiating a spiritual journey it‚Äôs necessary to strictly follow the rules provided by guru to keep itself available to guru at all levels all the time. 
In my understanding these rules and discipline will support my presence (attentiveness).","Due to my daily routine work which is already physically demanding for the average person. I am physically active and fit. I also practice Shambhavi Mahamudra daily which helped me shed 8 kilos and made me fittest ever. Yes, I can walk a long distance 5-6 kms barefoot daily on the ground. I sit in Ardhasiddhasana all the time and don't find any difficulty. I have never done farming, Gardening is my subject of interest. I maintain a few plants on the rooftop. I understand it is a different thing altogether. I think I might be capable of farming as well. It's a matter of opportunity for me if i get it i can do it. Considering the risk of snake bites in fields I can do it with guidance.","I will be happiest to be volunteering in the ashram, I have gone through long office hours happily (3-4 years) and intense physical work is my daily business. I have a trading and manufacturing business of metal hardwares, in this industry intense physical work is a regular thing. If i don't get much physical work i consider that day is not my happiest day, rest all are my happiest days. haha.","I lived in a hostel for about four years (2010-14), I don't find any struggle in sharing space. The good part is if there are many, they have to follow all rules of space, democracy wins.","My Mother will be saddest, i have a good connection with her though she understands my need she will be fine. My sister doesn't care, she must be happy as long as I am not at home(As I tease her all the time). My brother is fine and will respect my decision and he is more than capable of handling our family business. I already told my dad that I will be going to Sadhguru's ashram in July 2025 and the final decision will be taken by my teachers. My father called my decision stupid and told me that you are independent to take care of your needs. (Deep inside he just wants me to be happy) Also I think My family is ok in my absence as I solo travel every monsoon on mountains for 1-2 weeks, they don't get worried about me. I handle situations quite well. 
In conclusion: I am independent of taking this decision, my family is supportive and will be fine in my absence.",I don't have any query right now.,yes

Although this schedule is more demanding than my current one, it aligns with the direction I want to take in my life. I understand it won‚Äôt be easy, but I am ready to embrace it with an open mind and a willingness to grow.

I actually enjoy physical work, and sitting cross-legged feels natural to me, as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve done since childhood.

I understand that each task has its purpose, and I don‚Äôt want to be selective or seek comfort in what I do. My focus is on fully immersing myself in seva and embracing the experience, knowing that this is key to my personal growth.","Sharing space with many other volunteers, such as in a dormitory or shared bathroom facilities, is a bit outside my comfort zone, as I‚Äôm used to having more personal space. However, I see this as an opportunity for growth. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to work on, as learning to live and collaborate with others in close quarters will be valuable for me, not only during the program but also in life. I believe this experience will help me become more adaptable and open, which is a crucial part of the journey.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full seven-month duration of the program. While they may not fully understand all the aspects of the program, they trust my decisions and believe that it is for my own good.

I do not take days off. I am always actively engaged in something.","I am open and willing to take whatever activity given to me. I am not doing Sadhanapada because I would like to do nice activities that I want to do. I know that my purpose there is to challenge myself to break my limitations and to transform what I am into something more. That is what I want, so I will do physical or office-based work, or some other work. It is all the same to me, and I will happily perform any activity with the highest level of attention and intensity that I can.","I am completely comfortable with this aspect. I am at the ashram to deepen my sadhana and imbibe the full experience of the program. It may require some adjustment period to learn how to share and keep the space with other volunteers specifically per the ashram requirements, but as I am now, I already have shared facilities where I live with others, and I work closely with many different kinds of people every day at my job. All these things require that I follow a set of social guidelines and rules for them to be successful arrangements. I am quite well-mannered and respectful with people, so any social situations will most likely not be much of an issue for me.","My family is 100% supportive of my staying at the yoga center. My brother is an Isha meditator, and the rest of my family and friends understand how important Isha and the possibility of Yoga is to me.","What is the recommended amount of money to have saved for the duration of the program? Will I be able to take Isha programs during my stay at the ashram, such as bhava spandana, yogasanas, shoonya, etc.? At what point during this application process will I know for sure if I have been accepted into the program? Thank you.",yes

Then I was initiated into Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya and then I went through Bhava Spandana and then I got initiated into Shoonya. 
I have now realized that I have to work on making myself receptive to Grace which is ever present rather than what I was doing before which was trying to reach somewhere. I have also realized that I need to work towards my willingness and for that I wish to go through Sadhanapada at this particular time. 
There are many ways in which I am hoping to grow through the program which includes living in a consecrated space, building willingness through volunteering into Seva, living among other Sadhaka, regularity in the practice of Kriya.","Since the program is designed by Sadhguru himself, I can see that the design looks challenging and at the same time necessary to bring the willingness in the participant that is required for their transformation. To transform myself the way the program expects, it makes sense to fully commit to the guidelines and requirements given. I see all these as necessary to create enough willingness to be ""ON"" all the time.","I feel the activities can be physically demanding but at the same time essential to learn what it takes to be involved into something.

Initially it was difficult for my parents to understand why I am doing what I was doing, but gradually they have come to terms that they have told me to do whatever I feel is best for my life. The relationship between me and my parents is in much better health now and I am sure they don't mind me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program as long as I know that this is the best thing to do for my life.","Since the Kailash Mansarovar Sacred Walk for 2025 falls under the duration of Sadhanapada, is it possible for a participant of Sadhanapada to register for that Sacred Walk too during the Sadhanapada?",yes

By participating in the program, I want to commit myself and stay at the ashram for at least 7 continuous months to fully immerse myself into the yogic practices Sadhguru offered and see the profound impacts theses practices bring. In the end, I hope to explore deeper on the nature this life. In addition, I aspire to become a better version of myself after these 7 months, where hopefully I will be a more balanced, stable and joyful human being with more compassion and clarity in life. I just have a deep longing for self exploration and transformation and I just know that there is nothing in the world right now that is potent and powerful as Sadhanapada. And for the past 2 years, Sadhanapada has always been in the back of my mind.","I revered the way Sadhguru designed the strict daily schedule at the ashram and I know it is done with the best intentions. Therefore, I will do my best to willingly adhere to the daily schedule, knowing that it's designed to bring the best out of each individual and to prepare them for higher possibilities of life.","I grew up in rural parts of Vietnam so I feel comfortable and familiar with the ashram's way of life. For the most part such as walking on dirt roads and farming, I have been exposed to that before in my childhood. But as for other yogic challenges such as sitting on the floor crossed legs, which I have not done very often in the past, I will give my best to these new requirements, as I'm sure my body will adjust accordingly overtime.","I am willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activities for the duration of the program as I remind myself to not have any rigid expectations about how anything should be. As I know these volunteer activities will present a perfect opportunity for me to learn something new, and will also help me to expand my current levels of limitation.",I feel comfortable living in the dormitory areas with other participants and don't really have a high standards of how my accomadations should be.,"My family is very encouraging of whatever I want to pursue in life, so they support me for participating in Sadhanapada.",None at this point.,yes

Sadhana has completely changed me. I have 15 years of work experience. I have achieved a lot of success in my work, but the inner pain, struggle and confusion are inevitable until I practice yoga. At first time I did my SadhanaÔºåduring the mandala, I felt relaxed from my heart. After practicing every morning, I became very clear. After working in a complex business and personnel environment for a whole day and returning home, it was like my body was covered with dirt. I felt much cleaner after practicing. The continuous practice made me feel very happy. For the first time, I felt joy (not only joy). After participating in the Inner Engineering volunteer work for the first time, I seemed to have gained a great change. I can be more involved and relaxed in dealing with scenes in work and life without friction. Many things are progressing very quickly. 
In July 2023, I decided to resign my job, I hoped to devote myself to Isha's programs, Sadhana and volunteer works; During this year, I participated in all the activities, programs and Asia-Pacific volunteer works which I could participate in/. Every time I felt some changes, I would feel that Sadhana is so prowerful, but at the same time I could feel that I was still in a very early stage. When we joinning in the sacred walk program, Guru encouraged us not to be entangled, come to the center, and participate in Sadhanapada. After thatÔºåI am eager to participate in Sadhanapada and learn how to do Sadhana well, and I am eager to undergo such a challenge. I hope to be able to build a more stable foundation in the Sadhanapada program thoroughly and comprehensively dismantle the accumulation of ""I"", be able to accept Sadhanapada‚Äôs training, and maintain my Sadhana under any circumstances, not only for a happy life and work, but for the blossoming and thorough enlightenment of this life; I hope to learn and prepare myself through Sadhanapada and then offer this life to Sadhguru and devote myself to various volunteer work of Isha. I have already made the financial arrangements needed for my family. My family and I are ready for this for me and my husband (my husband has also applied for Sadhanapada and hopes to engage in full-time work in Isha in the future), so I hope to apply for Sadhanapada now.","I have a clear understanding of the strict schedule during the Sadhanapada program and the lack of private time and the need to follow arrangements. I am eager to experience such a strong Sadhana. I know that this is a very sophisticated program designed by Sadhguru, and I am eager to experience this great program. Every time I participate in Isha's volunteer works and programs, I can always feel that there are many subtle coincidences in what work I am assigned to, what situations I encounter, and what partners I work with, which help me recognize or break through some unconscious limitations. I can feel that it is full of grace. No matter what the work is, no matter what the center arranges, I believe it is part of the course. I fully accept it and will work hard to do my Sadhana well, and strive to evolve quickly in this precious opportunity.","Guru has mentioned in many videos about how to sit, and how to stay healthy. I know that every program of Isha is carefully designed, even to a degree that we can't imagine. I know that these arrangements are for us to fully experience this course and realize what this course hopes to achieve. This is also what I have put aside all worldly desires to experience. I fully accept all physical and various arrangements, and I will face and complete all arrangements with tenacity.","I have no expectations or requirements for the arrangement of volunteer work. No matter what work is assigned to me, I will definitely to do my best. I know that this is beyond the logic and calculation of the mind. In the past year or so, I have participated in many volunteer‚Äòs work in the Asia-Pacific region. From the first time I deeply felt that volunteer work is a very remarkable ""course"", I gradually felt that there are many experiences beyond logic. I was once assigned to clean the toilet in the BSP course. Due to the lack of water in the previous Gent's program, the toilet could not be flushed, so this work became very difficult, but in the process of facing this work, I realized a lot of limitations and broke through a lot. I felt sweet, warm and determined. I am often assigned to work that I may not be good at subjectively, but every time I put in work, I find that I have gained a lot, so I have no expectations for these. I am sincerely grateful to the people who made arrangements for volunteer work behind. And thank them for creating opportunities for us to face and break through ourselves.","I am eager to let go of the limitations of ""I"" when I join SP. I have no requirements for such external limitations. We have experienced different environments and situations in past courses and volunteer work. In fact, after a day's work, it is enough to have a place to sleep and a simple shower. Occasionally, when volunteer work requires it, we can spread a yoga mat on the floor to sleep without any obstacles. From a material perspective, I have no demand for these, just follow the arrangements of the center.","After practicing yoga for the past two years, my family has seen the changes with my husband and me, and they also hope that we can become healthier and happier. When I quit a good job in 2023 and hoped to devote all my time to yoga, they were supportive and accepted it. My family members are all capable of living independently, and my husband and I have the same wish, and our family also wishes us well in getting the offer from Sadhanapada program.","I heard that due to the long visa approval situation in China, some participants missed the Sadhanapada program after receiving offer.

I can always go back to the memory of my first volunteering experience for the IE program in Hong Kong. I was not willing, in fact, I was being reluctant and grudging for having the idea of doing volunteer work, but my wife insisted, so I went along. On the first evening, I was lying on the bed in the hotel room and complaining to my wife saying :""Why the hell am I here cutting vegetables and doing all nonsense while I have a lot of work to do for my own project?"". I had many conflicts with the coordinator during the day, questioning and challenging her about the detailed procedures and the written code of conduct. When she told me to re-dice the vegetables according to her standard, I almost smashed the knife on the table, I can never forget what I told her on sight:"" You come to cut it to your satisfaction if you are not satisfied with mine, I've had enough."" 
 
I had no idea of what ""volunteer"" meant, and I didn't realize how far I was from being a volunteer in life, almost everything I did in life was done with great resistance and fantasy, and now that I look back, with hallucinations. 
 
I didn't say anything at the final meeting, where people shared their experiences. I couldn't wait for the program to finish. I didn't feel much, and I didn't gain much. I thought two days were wasted just like that. 
 
Halfway home on the train, tears started to come, and a few minutes later I started to cry heavily and bitterly. The program touched something deep within, and that was the first time for me to realize that the volunteering part is one of the most important parts of the IE program, that moment I realized how ignorant I was for being arrogant and judging everything I saw in life. As it turned out, it was not ""two days wasted"" as I imagined at the beginning, it was that I almost wasted such a precious opportunity for being able to volunteer for the program. 
 
It was June 2023, my first grumpy yet life-changing experience. Then the next one came in July, and then August, then it went on just like that. 
 
Up to this point, I have volunteered for four IE programs, Guru Pooja, Shoonya, BSP for Gents and for Ladies. 
 
The volunteer programs opened me up, so much so to the point that I came to realize nothing in material life can satisfy me, nothing can compare to the peace and joy inside this body, and the feeling of making programs complete and see that people being transformed was THE most touching experience I've ever had in life. Programs like these made me understand that life is not just about this being getting something for him/herself, it's about devoting this life to make something happen. 
 
My wife and I went to Kailash Yatra for the second time, and this particular yatra was another major life-changing journey so far. 
 
As we go deeper into the spiritual path, we decided to do everything as if we were volunteering for programs, and we decided to be fully involved in a real-estate project in Sichuan, partnering with our friends and other business partners. We were very decisive about this, and that was just around 10 days before we went for the 2024 Sacred Walk. 
 
On the day we arrived in Lhasa, we shared our stories and plans with Ishanga JiaRui and his wife. ""Why are you taking such a detour"" Said JiaRui. What they said shocked me. Why would he say that what we were about to do was a detour, it was a sincere choice of walking the spiritual path. On the same night, Ishanga Tanvi said the exact same thing. It took me one day to digest, and then I eventually realized that they were right. Why don't I just go directly onto the spiritual path instead of running around playing the social game. 
 
I was connected with Mahadev during this Kailash Yatra. 
 
Without knowing when the borderline conflict will be resolved between China and India so that we can apply for India Visa, and without knowing what's going to happen in our lives, we decided to give 100% percent to the ultimate truth, and never take any socially conjured detours again. We shut down the company, sold the apartment, wrapping up everything so that we could be 100% with this spiritual path. Then people told us that we should apply for this upcoming Sadhanapada. The idea of applying for this program slipped away in year 2023, now we think it's finally the time that we do this. 
 
We want to become mentally stable with constant clarity, and physically endurable so that we can do heavy-duty work. I remember that Sadhguru said ""One can always look back to the Sadhanapada program"" because he/she has built this solid foundation, and I want to have this foundation so that I can be ready for whatever might come next. I'm willing to do whatever Sadhguru or Isha tells me to do. I want Sadhguru's wisdom and his teaching to fully imbibe with this being, and I want to become someone like a Bhramachariya, like a stone or a brick, to become someone who's able to handle all kinds of situations and do whatever spirituality tells this being to do. 
 
I am willing, and I am ready.","I firmly believe that it would train and grind me into such a being which grows toward it's full-fledged form, as I mentioned in the first question, volunteering experience changed me fundamentally, from an arrogant being to become a loving being, from being rigid to being flexible with clarity. 
I believe that the strict daily schedule and everything I will experience during the Sadhanapada will help resolve whatever the nonsense I have left within me.","No promblems, just tell me what to do.",100% willing. Anything the program assigns me to do.,No problems at all.,"They are fully aware that my wife and I will spend the rest of our lives to walk this spiritual path, and they are being very supportive, we don't have anything to worry about each other, and they are very happy to see that we are becoming healthier, happier, and more loving and humble.",No other questions.,yes

Trial is a Must can also be a good idea so that he knows what he is getting into which even after the discussion seems like it has not sunk in. But he is also committed to Sadhguru. So that emotion may help him overcome it.

He likes that in Isha everyone is treated equally no matter the age, gender, education, English speaking skills etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He fees hes at the crossroads and want to dedicate his life in a meaningful way for spirituality and he feels SP is the way to bring about this transition. His wife had to be away for work for 5 years when his kids were very young and he had to take care of them like a mother. He really enjoyed the feminine side of him and he is sure SP will help him deepen his connection with the kids - He said he wanted to have a relationship with his kids - he said he wants to have ""minimal conversation with maximum understanding"". (Applicant had written a detailed list of reasons for why SP. We covered a few of them in detail during the call as well.)",None,,English (US) (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Medium,Fluent,,,,,,,,,,Only IE,"There are various reasons to write about ""Why this particular time"". I will try to write down points. 
P1: 
I have been working in the Indian Space Research Organization(ISRO),Govt Of India as a scientist since 2001.For the last few years I have added my leaves one by one. And now is the time when I have sufficient leaves to complete the program as required for 7 months. I wish to invest my leaves for such a greater purpose where my life gets ready for time to come. 
 
P2: 
I have two daughters 9 year and 13 year old. Being a father of teenage girls, to understand them more closely, more clearly and especially to understand them with minimal or without any verbal communication, it is very much essential for me to know myself. This is a very crucial time of my life. A single slip of understanding between me and them may lead towards any direction. 
At the time of completion of this program in 2026 they will be turning 11 and 15 year respectively. I am 200% sure that Sadhanapada will help me to grow into a good human once I complete my inner journey. 
With active intervention in spiritual, emotional, and physical areas as Sadhanapada offers a structured environment for such transformation, providing tools, discipline, and a space to consciously work through these internal shifts, I will be able to contribute better in their life also along with my own. I can be a better version of myself to support my wife in the overall development of our family. 
 
P3: 
Sometimes, I feel that something is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù despite external accomplishments. 
Choosing Sadhanapada at this particular time will help me to tap into deeper layers of life beyond the material, to understand my true nature, and to explore the deeper questions of existence. 
 
P4: 
At this very moment I really feel a transformation in the inner core of myself towards a greater life. This is a turning point for me. I am at the crossroads of my life. Sadhanapada provides both the space and the tools for deep reflection, helping me to gain clarity about my life‚Äôs purpose and the path to take that leads towards a state of enlightenment. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sadhanapada program, focuses on intensive self-transformation through yogic practices, discipline, inner work and seva. 
 
I would like share a part of my life from 2018 when my daughters were on 3 and 7 yers old. My wife had to shift Delhi from Ahmadabad for her office assignment. She was there for 5 years till 2023. Daughters, me, and a maid(for support) stayed in Ahmedabad. During this time when I was taking care of a three year old girl who still wear diapers and on her way of leaning phase of expressing herself in words, I realised that feminine part in side my male looking structure is very strong. She used to call me mother until her friends and social friend corrected her. 
I believe every male has some percentage of feminine nature in him. if I did not have this feminine layer in me then perhaps I would not have been able to raise my little daughters for so long. 
Sadhanapada for sure will nurture and nourish my feminine core. I hope it will flourish and bloom in multi dimension through the program. When I say ""I am the mother to the world"", I really wish to attain the level of MOTHER. 
 
 
 
P1: Through the program I hope to dive into deeper states of self-awareness and consciousness,understanding the nature of the self and the universe. Transcending the limitations of the mind and body to experience a deeper connection with life, beyond the material and ego- 
based identities. 
 
P2: Through the program I hope improvement in physical health and fitness through regular yogic practices like asanas, kriyas, and other physical disciplines. Development of better alignment, flexibility, and energy levels, experiencing the body as a more stable and vibrant force for life. 
 
P3: What I like the most is to live in harmony with a group, building a sense of community and contributing positively to a shared environment. Doing our own work and seeing all work as a 
spiritual practice. 
 
P4: I do believe that this program will strengthen my concentration through meditative practices,leading to sharper focus and less mental clutter. This will cultivate calmness in the face of challenges, reducing stress and emotional reactivity. 
 
P5: Last but not the least clear path for ""Nirvana"" and liberation from the cycle of life and death","I strongly believe that the structured schedule of Sadhanapada is designed to create an intense environment for self-transformation. As I am looking for a profound, focused journey inward(within), it could be deeply rewarding. 
This environment is designed to break habitual patterns, providing an opportunity for transformation. This is the most tempting part of the program. Adjusting to rules about diet, sleep, and conduct might be challenging initially so what? Following this schedule for sure will lead to the true end result and purpose of the program.","The physical demands of Sadhanapada serve as a powerful tool for growth, but they also present real challenges. They build resilience, physical endurance, and provide grounding. 
 
Walking long distances is not a concern. It's a regular practice for me. Walking around sacred and consecrated places help us to imbibe the energy transmitted in that area. This will prepare us for the rest of the day. 
 
Farming can be a little bit challenging as I need to re-learn it. After joining my job I am away from farming activity. Though I visit my farm on a regular basis and in touch with farming activities but due to involvement of different agriculture machines human interaction have reduced. I used take care of cows, providing food to them, cleaning their area, sowing, harvesting, preparing farm etc in my childhood till my college times. Farming keeps us grounded and connected with the earth element. 
 
Sitting cross leg is a part of daily life. We do our breakfast ,dinner and other daily activities at home in sitting position. 
 
Other activity like seva in Bhiksha Hall, kitchen, cleaning of ashram, volunteering at Dhyanalinga and Linga Bhairavi, other programs in the ashram, I strongly believe that it has a ripple effect on one‚Äôs capacity to handle challenges in other areas of life. The key is in embracing the discomfort as part of the process of breaking old patterns and developing inner strength.","Very truly stating that I have no such choice. 
I am OK with any volunteering activity. 
It may be physically intense(I may not be able to lift heavy weight alone) or office based. 
It may be cleaning toilets, sweeping or mopping, taking care of visitors, cutting vegetables, washing utensils and other kitchen. 
If there‚Äôs flexibility, i would like to explore different areas like gardening, cooking, volunteering in different departments, or other forms of seva (service), alongside my core practices. 
I like teaching. I can take science/maths/physics classes for kids. I did my M.Tech in Electronics Design and Technology. I can do seva in field of engineering, designing and development of construction area, model making, creating animations to explain science of spirituality. 
 
As a farmer i can be assigned farming activity for example water flow management,sprinkler,rain gun and other water management setup, more crop par drop farming, post harvesting crop management, natural farming, solar setup for sustainable energy.","I belong to middle class family. I have 6 sisters. I was brought in a small house. 2BHK house was shared in 11 members, 6 sisters, my grand repents, my parents and me. We had sliding beds shared by two members of family. When ever guest were at home, we used to sleep on floor. It may be summer or winter. We shared not only bed but blankets also. This is how I have lived for 17 years. This culture is still alive in family. As after marriage and two kids per family, we are grown to 30 member family [7(Sibling) x 2 (Spouse) =14, 14 kids(Youngest of 6year and Eldest of 28year, 6girls 8 boys) and 2 (my parents)]. Hence sharing facilities for 7 months will have no impact on my practice. Also I can take care of other participant by creating a comfortable sharing environment. Doing my own early morning activity on time. Leaving toilets and bathroom clean proper flush after use. keeping stay are tidy and clean. Not leaving unfolded bedding. 
 
One may think that sharing with siblings is easy where as sharing with unknown person from different culture or different part of world will be difficult. I believe when we stay together with shared common goal, sharing any other things hardly matres. During my hiking and biking camps, scout guide camps and other such activities I have shared facility.","I am doing Isha practices for a loang time and my family has seen the changes / benefits that it has brought to me. 
They are supportive to me in my current practices. 
I have discussed the details of this program to my family and they are ok with my stay in Ashram for 7 months. 
Also in the present day , the technology has reduced the gap, we can have video calls / live sessions so that the kids do not feel my absence.",NA,yes

Sadhanapada, with its intensity and commitment, seems like a powerful catalyst for this growth.","I understand that following a strict daily schedule with limited personal time, no days off, and fully adhering to the program's expectations and ashram guidelines will require significant discipline and commitment. While it sounds challenging, I see it as a necessary part of the transformative journey that Sadhanapada offers. By immersing myself in this structured lifestyle, I‚Äôm allowing myself to step away from familiar habits and comforts, which I believe can lead to greater inner clarity and growth.","I feel both challenged and motivated by the physical demands of the program. Walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and engaging in activities like farming will test my physical endurance and adaptability. However, I see this as an opportunity to strengthen my body and to cultivate resilience.","I am fully willing to be assigned to any volunteering activity, whether it is physically intense or office-based, for the full duration of the program. I understand that volunteering is an essential aspect of the Sadhanapada experience, and it will likely push me to step outside my comfort zone and develop new skills. Whether it involves physical labor, like farming or manual work, or administrative tasks in an office, I am ready to contribute with a mindset of service and humility. I see it as an opportunity to cultivate a sense of responsibility, patience, and teamwork, and I am committed to giving my best to whichever task I am assigned, as it is all part of the transformative journey.","I feel open and receptive to sharing space with other volunteers, as I understand that it is a natural part of the Sadhanapada experience. While it may require adjustments, particularly in terms of personal space and privacy, I see it as an opportunity to cultivate patience, adaptability, and community spirit. Sharing a dormitory, communal bathrooms, and participating in group activities can foster a sense of unity and collective purpose, which is integral to the ashram environment.","My family understands and supports my desire to attend Sadhanapada for the full duration of the program. They recognize that this experience is important for my personal growth, well-being, and spiritual journey. Although they may feel a bit concerned about my absence and the challenges I might face, they respect my decision and trust that the program will positively impact me. Knowing that I am pursuing something meaningful and transformative gives them confidence, and I feel grateful for their encouragement as I take this step.","I have a few questions about the program that would help me prepare more fully:

1. Develop clarity : After attending Samyama in December 2022, my life completely turned upside down. The experience has been too intense and mystical to even articulate. The old structure within me just crumbled. Nothing of mine remained. I became alien to myself. For the first time in my life, I didn't know what to do with my life except for the intense longing to rediscover my purpose and hasten my spiritual growth. Now I want to give my time and effort to develop clarity and direction within myself. 
 
2. Intensify sadana : Outside ashram, it is quite difficult to practice all sadanas regularly due to time restrictions, lack of committed atmosphere, schedule and support. In ashram, one can immerse fully in intense sadana because of highly energetic consecrated space, well structured schedule and support. I did intense sadana for a month during my samyama preparation and I saw immense change in terms of physical, mental, emotional and energetic aspects. If practicing intensely just for a month can give such great results, I wonder how drastic, immense and life changing, it can be if one practices intensely for 7 months! 
 
3. Consecrated space : Consecrated space can ignite one's energy system into different dimension and ultimate possibility. It helps one to lead concentrated and highly vibrant life. 
 
4. Strong foundation : I want to first build stable platform interms of body, mind, emotions and energy to explore the ultimate spiritual possibility. I want to develop unwavering focus, discipline and dedication. I want to be able to handle both big and small tasks or challenges without getting overwhelmed or stressed out. 
 
5. Spiritual growth : I have been an intense seeker of truth from a very young age. I have had many profound questions about the universe, life and the nature of reality. I have found answers to few of my questions after coming in contact with Sadhguru but many are still unanswered. I am rigorously and consistently searching answers through the yogic science. I want to know the very source of my life and the creation at any cost. I want to mature spiritually as fast as possible and explode into the ultimate possibility of being a human. 
 
6. Joy of volunteering : volunteering is a wonderful opportunity to offer oneself through action. Its a powerful process, where one can loosen up rigid personality structures, to become absolute willing and open to life. I want to grow beyond my limited likes and dislikes, ideas and opinions and become willing, flexible and open through selfless involvement. I want to be able to treat every action, whether it's small or big, with equal involvement and devotion. There is immense joy and satisfaction in volunteering. 
 
7. Poornanaga and bramhacharya : After samyama, I don't seem to find satisfaction and fulfillment in any of the activities concerning the outside world. A sense of incompleteness is growing within me as I try to involve more and more with the outside world. On the contrary, there is a deep sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in offering oneself as volunteer at ashram. In this two years period, I have developed a strong desire or inclination towards becoming full time volunteer and eventually may be brahmacharya. So I want to use sadanapada as a testing ground to see if it is the right thing for me.","Though it can be difficult at times, I am willing enough to strictly adhere to the requirements and expectations of the program.",This is quit easy to me as I am a hardcore trekker! I do have prior experience in farming.,"I am open, flexible and willing enough to take on any activity without bringing in personal priorities.","This may be slightly uncomfortable for me as I tend keep my space very clean and vibrant. I do get disturbed by body odors, smell of unwashed clothes and seeing unhygienic habbits of others but I am inclusive enough to adjust.",My family is always supportive of my decisions.,"Can I get to meet sadhguru during sadanapada? 
I have no further questions as I am confident and willing enough to adhere to the requirements and face any challenges that may come up.",yes

So I firstly ask sorry If I am writing more and if it is confusing. I heard about Isha yoga centre when I enrolled for pursuing Ph.D degree in biotechnology in Tamilnadu. I always wanted to do research that will help the society which is based on Indian traditional medicine. So I went to learn that in Tamilnadu being native of Banglore city. It was all going good until few years back maybe until 2021. I started noticing that I had reduced my self-confidence and not able communicate with people. From past one and half year I was in this confused mind. Then I started searching for yoga and meditation courses which I can learn in very less amount of fees. Because I don't have any good financial support. This year Feb when Sadhanapada program finished, there were lots of new and videos on youtube, after which once again I looked towards Isha yoga centre. Than I realised that, this kind of gurukula model meditation and training will help me to make better person and inturn I can come back to my path of self realization (what I am missing) . Than I went through may youtube videos, In one video, where a lady tells she was in confusion whether to go for MBA aboard or to go for Sadhanapada...?. After sadanapadha she realised that this was a life changing experience and she can face any situation and balance her mind. Like this few others experience motivated or I can say it was like my mind voice saying that this is which I was looking from many years. 
Than I enrolled in inner engineering after few months. I was inconsistent from earlier in any practice and that has been deeper so tightly that I alone cannot break it even after trying repeatedly. So I wanted something like this gurukula kind of system with continuously monitor and motivates to keepup my practice and do corrections where ever I do mistakes in practice. In today's world where money is required for learning and if no money no guidance, sadanapada program is the real hope for people like me I feel. I pray that this will be a foundation for my self realisation of what is my purpose and who do I fulfill the wish that I need to help the society which am I debt always. 
I think I have told what are the things I got in mind. Please forgive me if I hurt the feeling and emotions of the Isha yoga centre. I do always respect the for the effort they are making to bring better persons in everyone and makes a beautiful society.

In the 21 days hatha programms, i realized that even with much activity, waking up early and having not much personal choice about timings of activities and rules of living in that space is the best way to live in the ashram, because otherwise it wont be commited and a space where people grow.

I have been doing job from past 15years and was married for 10yrs, always focused on building my career and making money. In late 2022 my wife got ill and was hospitalised where I spent all my time taking care of her getting all the medical help and all the prayers I could offer, but still after 3 months she passed away. 
The sudden grief hit me with a huge void, and that is when I started with Isha Kriya. When nothing was helping me, practising isha kriya helped me be sane and deal with my grief. With that I also stared with upa-yoga, which further helped me open up to myself and deal with the grief that I had, also giving me energy to get my motivation back to do the work. 
After that I completed my IE and got initiated to Shambhavi, which helped me be more happy and be grateful for the life. I was even able to help few colleagues with depression to get over it and also helping them to do IE program. It is almost an year now for me practicing the Shambhavi. People around me, my family and myself could feel the inner growth within myself which was never before. I started to have a different perspective of life. 
 
With all that transformation, it suddenly hit me that whatever I have done till now was just to full fill my desires but there is no limit to it. I now want to touch my inner most dimension. I want to contribute to upliftment of this world. For which I have to do things which I have never done before. But all of my life I have been filled with fear of failure, discrimination of the kind of work and many more which is holding me back to take steps that are necessary to help this world be a better place. 
I am currently in UK, leaving my job in March 2025, and moving back to India to enter the next phase of my life. Since, I don't have any kinds, my parents are in good health & living in India, and my only dependent was my wife (who passed away last year), I can now peacefully be part of the greater transformation through Sadhanapada and spend my time from May/2025 till the program lasts. Having earned all these years also provides me with the financial independence for that period. 
With Sadhanapada, I am hoping to get an environment where the demanding processes will transform me, grow my innerself, help me know my ownself through the sadhanas, surpass all comforts that is limiting me by doing all the yoga practices.","I will be in full comfort at the time of death. Therefore while I am alive, I want to live with fullness. We look for personal time, days off, other distractions when we are doing something that we don't fully value. I am willing that is why I am applying for Sadhanapada. Therefore with agreeing to be part of the program, I am agreeing to follow the full schedule religiously and with full commitment. From waking up at 4:30am to eating only 2wice a day. I opted to be part of Sadhanapada for a purpose and if I continue following the same old habits, then the purpose of inner growth is defeated. The daily schedule not matching my own will make me open to learn new things, improve my perspective of life further. With no responsibilities, I can easily turn off my phone, be more available to the process and so that I can fully transform my life. I am fully prepared to follow the full guidelines to get the best out of this program.","In past I did 10 days of sadhana where I had to sit for 6hrs a day cross legged. I am always excited about connecting with the mother earth, therefore I frequently walk in nature for 7-10kms, do my shambhavi on sitting down on the floor. Although, I have not done that in for longer durations, therefore I know it is going to be demanding. 
As I am preparing myself for the next phase of the life, breaking my limitations and going beyond my current physical comfort is also a requirement. I want to connect with the nature however I can, be it walking, farming, or via sadhana by sitting cross legged on the ground. I am mentally prepared to do the same.","I have done volunteering where I have served others in food halls, made food in kitchen and cleaned larger areas after used by large public. Those activities end up giving me peace and inner happiness. 
Also, most of my life I have been working to fulfil my desires, which has created a lot of compulsions in myself which sometimes brings anxiety and unhappiness. I want to break free from my own compulsions, therefore I am willing to do any work that is needed, which will help me understand the different perspective of life, break my own mental blockers and help me support the community and the nature.","I am truly excited about sharing spaces. I grew up in a family where I shared a room with other 2 siblings. Therefore sharing common areas and bathrooms have never been a problem for me. 
Having others who are on the similar path truly helps the individuals like me motivated everyday.","My family is fully supportive for me in taking this step. They know how wonderfully isha practices have transformed me after the death of my wife. They are also into spiritual journey, therefore they understand to truly transform ones inner requires effort equivalent to moving a mountain. And Sadhanapada is one of kind that will help me with my journey",Not that I can think of.,yes

She is looking at SP as tool for breaking her limitations and resistance towards unpleasant or uncomfortable life situations and deepen her already ongoing practice and spiritual path. 
‚úîShe knows people who went through the program, and she saw their transformation and glow after programs. She wants the same. She didn‚Äôt apply sooner as she felt insecure about money/apartment/job to come to India for a long time. But now, she feels it is the right time, and she is fully ready, and she went through all other programs as preparation and is 100% sure she could make this commitment to come to SP
‚úî IE ‚Äì finished 2021 online. Sadhguru deeply touches her, and since she started doing practice (as soon as it was available), she feels like she started to live life and that that was the best decision of her life. She is more comfortable in difficult situations, has more joy and energy during the day, is more balanced, and can focus more on solutions instead of anger.

Everything that is considered a ""good life"". But there is something very much missing which I would call as profoundness, for lack of better words. Although, I have all this comfort and convenience, the urge to do something really worthwile and existentially valuable with my life is burning within me for few years now. I noticed that all this comfort and ""security"" is making me dull and creates more and more limitations/boundaries and resistance towards new things/changes in my life. For example, the thought of loosing my job causes so much anxiety and stress within me, as if there would not be any other possibilties in my life than this particular job. I realized, that I am really loosing my flexibility and agility to mold myself in different ""shapes"" as situations change. And this emptiness which all this causes in me reached a point where I clearly see/feel that it is not acceptable anymore. I am burning to explore the nature of me as a human being in its fullest depth and dimentsion and shift my focus completely inward. I am definitely determined to gain my flexibility and freedom back, which I had as a child. I don't want to live on the surface anymore and only experience deeper dimensions when I am volunteering or doing any activity with Isha. I want this profoundness and joy in my daily life. I think using Sadhanapada as tool for breaking my limitations and resistance towards unpleasant or uncomfortable life situations would make the change that I want to create.The structure that is given in the program would definitely be a huge support to keep up the motivation, enthusiasm and energy to keep going. Also having fixed times for guided Sadhana together with all participants gives a great boost to stick to the commitment to take up and of course complete the program. I'm striving to live a fullfilled, profound life which is worthwhile for myself and others around me. I am willing to commit and give myself to the process of the program and make use of everything which is given by Sadhguru and the energized space in the Ashram. I am willing to confront/overcome my gratest fears of insecurity and uncomfort of giving up my life as I know it till now and fully be present in the program for the whole duration whatever it takes. Never before in my life I felt so cristal clear that now is the time to invest in my inner growth and to do whatever is needed for it. I have the vision that I take up this path and stay for long term volunteering and become a Pournanga in the Ashram. Sadhanapada program is my first step towards this larger ""goal"" of mine.","It will challenge me a lot to stay open and accept all situations that are occuring and overcoming the resistance withing me. But also I know that if I'm willing to grow I can handle everything with joy and go through the program without struggle. Since I am also a very structured person and following a kind of schedule in my daily life, I can apapt to the strict daily schedule and fixed times for different activities. I'm familiar with the guidelines of staying in the Ashram as I have been there already, so this is not a problem.","I am practicing Isha Yoga daily since more than 3 years now and also practice sitting in Ardhasiddasana while eating or watching TV at home, I think I am physically not bad prepared at least. Furthermore I am danicing Salsa and Batchata 4x/week for 2-4h/day which is also very intensly training the whole body. There will definitely be challenging times where my body would feel week or sth. but overall I'm quite confident that I can manage.",I trust the structure of the program designed by Sadhguru and will take up whatever activity will be given to me.,This will be my greatest challenge to be honest. But at the same time I'm willing and striving to break these limitations I have and make myself flexible to handle such situations effortlessly.,My mother will miss me of course and also needs to arrange with the new situation of not hearing from me as often as now but she is very supportive and knows how valuable this experience will be for my life.,"When will I get the reply whether I am accepted for the program or not?

But once I started practicing Shambhavi, I had the urge to do more programs. I started volunteering for local city center activities and could not stop going for more. With each program, and each volunteering activity I kept breaking some limitation in me. I am a much more capable version of myself compared to the person I was before Inner Engineering. I have wasted so much of my life trying to get somewhere or achieve something. I think I have found everything I need in Sadhguru and I do not want to waste any more time of this very short life. I wish to enhance my ability to experience life, I want to make myself more established and settled within myself. Without settling the chaos within me, I do not think I am of any good use to myself or anyone around me. I wish to go through Sadhanapada to establish myself, to settle my inner chaos, to break my limitations, and be more useful and available for myself and the people around me. I am certain the consecrated space in ashram is going to be a tremendous support in this transformative process.","A strict schedule that will be completely dedicated to Sadhana and Seva is going to be very conducive for my growth. Having very little personal time might be a challenge initially, but hopefully, I will be freed from that limitation within me. Strictly adhering to the requirements and expectations of the program will be the most beneficial for me above anyone else. And finally, I am looking forward to staying in the ashram and living the ashram way.","I am comfortable with the physical demands of the program, it may be challenging initially but with consistent Hatha Yoga practices the physical limitations will be taken care of.",I am willing to do any kind of activity my Guru thinks is needed for my growth.,"It will be a challenge to share dormitory stay areas and bathroom facilities. Although I have stayed in shared rooms and hostels previously, but with age you tend to start getting set in your ways and start seeking more privacy. I am aware this is a limitation in me as well, it would be very freeing to break this limitation.","I have my parents and my elder sister in the family. My sister and my mom are completely on board with me staying in the ashram. My father is on the fence, he understands how important one's spiritual growth is but he doesn't completely agree with anyone spending so long in the ashram. My sister did Hatha Yoga Teacher Training in 2023, he wasn't on board with the idea initially but he came around in some time. I understand that owing to his old age he is seeking support from his children, for which my sister and brother-in-law are completely available to take care of anything that may be needed while I am in the ashram.","Currently, I do not have any questions about the program.",yes

He has wanted to come for along time but life situations have not been right. In the year he got selected he got Covid and was into quarantine so he missed the last batch of SP. After that next year there was a tax issue (details in legal) and then financial constraints. He wants SP to help him build discipline with his sadhana and also because he doesn't find his work as fulfilling. He likes volunteering.,Minor,"At 27 he got chest pain, his doctor told him it was nothing.",English (UK) (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Fast,Fluent,FALSE,10,Mahashivratri,Security Team,4,Inner Engineering,,,,IE ++,"Namaskaram, I was initiated to shambhavi in 2017, and have seen immense benefits in all aspects of my life due to it. However, whenever the work stress increased, my sadhana continuity broke, also under extreme work conditions external factors again started affecting me, these cycles have happened a few times now, in past 5 years. I want to learn to keep doing my sadhana with utmost intensity even in a very busy schedule and want to be as balanced as possible under any kind of external situation. 
 
I have been in phases where the sadhana is happening beautifully and I am in complete balance, but the growth has been slow, as whenever work pressure increased, I was not able to maintain my sadhana intensity. Last MSR 2024 volunteering in security team was an eye opener, during the volunteering I was able to perform my activities, which were very challenging and new for me effortlessly, without any impact on me, the balance I felt for a few months after the MSR volunteering was what I have been looking for.","For the sadhana to intensify and for me to gain a transformative sense of balance and clarity, i think the strict daily schedule is needed, and I am confident I will be able to follow it. 
 
Since all aspects of the program schedule are designed for personal growth, it is worth sacrificing the personal time. Anyways the most important aspects of my current usage of the personal time is already covered in the schedule, like sadhana, food and seva. Minimising mobile usage is something I would love to make a habit. If possible not using it at all for entertainment. Only using it if any activity is to be performed. 
 
In my current schedule, I have office work mostly morning 9 am to evening 9 pm and weekends I do local center Volunteering activities, so no days off is perfectly fine, since it's for volunteering, whatever be the activity. 
 
Staying in the ashram for 7 to 8 months will not be a concern, My parents are independent and i am single, so there is no urgent dependencies, i have been planning for financial backup for this for last 3 years, so now I am ready with that as well.","I enjoyed the barefoot walks I did all day during the 10 days of my volunteering for 2024 MSR volunteering. Since it was in security team, we had to go for long walks for rece of the points. Only crossing the metal bridge during the afternoon sun was a challenge, rest all made me feel more fit and energetic. 
 
Even as a participant for grace of yoga in 2022 MSR, even though shuttle service was provided, i preferred and enjoyed walking barefoot to the halls. 
 
I am used to going for long treks with local Isha Meditator friends, once in 3-4 weeks. These are on an average 5 to 8 km treks. 
 
Over the years I have been able to sit more time comfortably cross legged, as of now I am able to sit around 1 hr to 1.5 hrs comfortably cross legged, I want to improve this. 
 
Since I get to work from home, during farming season many times I stay in Mangalore my hometown and volunteer wherever possible with farming activities at my familial farms. After volunteering for save soil to conduct sessions for students, I have also myself become more aware of the deep relationship between soil health and plant health, and i practice the learnings of this daily in my small but beautiful balcony gardens, would love to show some pictures of the produce. I also manage a composting setup of 30 liters in my balcony to process daily kitchen waste, this has been running successfully for last 3 years. Also have been teaching it to Isha meditator friends, some have replicated it at their home.",I am completely willing to be assigned to any activity that needs my service for the full duration of the program.,I am perfectly ok with sharing space with others. This will be a good test of my sadhana. I did not find this a concern at all during my 10 days of MSR volunteering and BSP participation as well.,"My mother has been an Isha Meditator for 6 years. So she completely knows and has experienced the benefits of the practices and programs of Isha. My parents have been to the ashram twice and they have simply loved the experience of being in the ashram. My father is a retired central government employee so my parent's financial requirements are covered. They have also seen me closely volunteering for local center for last 3 years, both have contributed also in that, so they know it's for my own growth.","Do I need to bring my laptop, in case that will be useful for any volunteering activity ?",yes

Actually i would say that my main purpose to go through sadhanapada would be to grow spiritually and break my limitations as much as possible but i also understand that i need balance for that so i think sadhanapada will be both the foundation and the boost for me to grow as a life. living in the consecrated space and doing sadhana regularly and having the guidance of sadhguru is once in a lifetime oppurtunity and iam hoping that it will bring about transformation in me such that whatever i go through after that i remain steady and pursue spiritual growth. in a way iam hoping that it will bring such a balance in me such that i remain one pointed in my goal to realise my ultimate nature and at the same time enable me to handle whatever life throws at me without stumbling or falling down. so the seva i will get to do and the oppurtunity to do sadhana in consecrated spaces will mentally,physically,emotionally and spiritually enhance me and i think no where else i will get such a huge oppurtunity as this and i hope that i will become a enhanced human in all aspects especially spirtually.","i think the strict daily schedule is very much needed to knead me and i think that is what is needed to break so many limitations and having very little personal time is perfectly alright with me, and the no days off aspect will also be a big factor in breaking my limitations because i understand that a spiritual person is on all the time and i have to become like that and staying in the beautiful ashram absolutely be a pleasant experience however long it may be","iam the sort of person who would welcome physical challenges, so walking long distances, sitting cross legged and difficult activities like farming are something i will galdy take on",iam willing to be assigned to any kind of volunteering activity because i think whatever activity it may be it will be a very good experience where i focus on something for 7 days a week. so i am looking forward for activity whatever type it may be,i have no problem sharing my space with others whether it is in stay area or during volunteering,i think they understand the benefits of the program and what is involved in it and it is ok for them and iam not the provider for my family so they wont be having any trouble physically,i just want to know whether we get any sadhguru darshan,yes

My current work as a dentist is also physically demanding where I am constantly switching between dental chairs to see about 25-30 patients in a day doing fillings and extractions. During COVID I was in a dental college where we had 2 mouth masks on from 8am-5pm walking up and down a staircase carrying dental instruments (we were not allowed to use an elevator which was reserved for patients at that time). We were working through lunch so most of the days the only meal we had was dinner after coming home. Sometimes we were not even drinking water throughout the day because it would take extra time to remove the face shield, mouth mask, ect. Initially it was very challenging and I found myself stopping for a minute while going up the stairs. I would get very hungry and a little weak but eventually my body got adapted to it and even felt more energetic after I got used to the routine. I lost about 11-12kgs over the span of 9 months. I am sure this program will be just as challenging physically. Even if it a struggle initially I am sure my body will adapt to what is required of me. I will also try to prepare by exercising consistently and sitting cross legged at home.",I am happy and willing to volunteer wherever I am needed for the full duration whether it is physically intense or office based.,I don‚Äôt mind sharing space with others and do not find it uncomfortable.

When I read the guidelines of Bhairavi Sadhana, at first I thought I could not follow these guidelines. But I wanted to give it a try, and I was able to do 21 days of Bhairavi sadhana without any problem. Then I did Mahashivaratri sadhana. After this, there was no looking back.

At the end of 2023, I set out to try teaching Isha Hatha Yoga in Germany. However, I quickly realized that while I am someone who practice, I don‚Äôt feel the need to talk about it or encourage others to follow the same path. Additionally, I encountered resistance in the very rational German society toward what I was doing. So, teaching soon lost its purpose for me. After my return from India, not only did teaching fail to work out, but all the other activities I tried to establish to make a living independently also did not succeed. 
 
After months of struggle, I applied for my old job‚Äîa job I had promised myself never to return to before starting Hatha Yoga teacher training. That was about three months ago. For me, doors in Germany remained closed, which made me recall what Sadhguru had said when he came to the Hatha Yoga school during training. He said that if teaching didn‚Äôt work out, one should come back to the ashram. For some reason, those words stayed in my mind the whole time. 
 
When it became clear to me that returning to the ashram was my only path, I spoke with Lokendra Anna from the Hatha Yoga school and sought his advice on the best way to return as a long-term volunteer. After listening to me, he said the best option would be to do Sadhanapada. So I applied shortly after.","Sadhguru's guidelines have to be followed exactly, one-to-one, in the ashram outside of the Ashram.

But this thinking over time was turned into strong desire to go through this program as I am at a stage in my life although having a successful career and reaping all the benefits of a comfortable lifestyle, still makes me feel vacuous in terms of life experience as If I need to experience something different and new which my current lifestyle isn't offering anymore and something needs to change. 
 
From my previous experience in situations and circumstances looking backwards on reflecting these were the situations which made me strong, wise but also gave me a deeper experience of learning of life, I learnt that as a person I have potential which uncovers with not just difficult situations but also with wonderful moments in life. 
 
Sadhnapada is definitely a program which will enable me to not to just of being service to others but also go through different dimensions of life experience. I won't have this opportunity to be among people who have gathered for the same cause and are willing to give themselves into service, I am sure I will have lot to take away from which I won't have otherwise, in my mundane life routine which is so monotonous and unidirectional.","I am trying to discipline my current routine and lifestyle to suit my current Isha practices e.g. getting up early in the morning and making time for my practices everyday. At times I am struggling to give as much as time as I would love to get involved with other activities e.g. Volunteering but this becomes difficult mainly due to work commitments. 
I am curious that program will make my sense of personal freedom grow to bring more discipline and schedule in my lifestyle. I am looking forwards to get clarity and sense of balance in my life.","I feel these activities seems to be completely different to my lifestyle but I am still involved in Isha Practices which involves me to do certain positions/asanas for at least 1-2 hours throughout the day. I take on walks at work and able to achieve 10,000-14,000 step count everyday which is way less than what this program demands but I am looking forward to it.",I am willing to take on activities as offered as I believe some aspect of this program is to discover my own limitations or rather dormant skills or interest which I did not had the opportunity to experience and take part in my routine life.,"As a person I am always told, I get on with people easily. I like to know about people their beliefs, their motivations and how do they see life from their own experiences. I have attended Isha programs/sacred walks in the past and the experience left me with so much learning and crossing my own limitations and barriers put up on myself mentally and physically. 
so I believe sharing space/facilities will bring on another phase of experience and learning.","My family has always been supportive of my ambitions and life goals, I am currently living away from my family and anyhow see them few times a year as time and work responsibilities allow. 
Joining this program has been something I have discussed with my family and they see it as something I am keen to go through and agree with.","I am sure I will have questions during or after going through the program, right now I am willing to take on the program with curiosity and sense of wonderment.",yes

Secondly, with the growing interest in Isha, access to the ashram will become inevitably hard, and I want to spend some time in the ashram to be with Dhyanalinga. 
Thirdly, while my practice is concrete and I don't struggle with the dilemma of doing it or not every day, I think this is the right time to take it up a notch.","I think I'm ready for this. I tried something similar last year but just for 3 days- I stayed in a monastery in Thailand, volunteering, and following a strict schedule. While challenging at first, I had a really good time and found the experience quite valuable. I truly like being in the ashram and I want to closely experience the life of a renunciate even if briefly so.","I'm quite comfortable walking long distances. I've been living on and off in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand for the last 2 years, and that has helped me get used to being on foot a lot, sometimes even with my rucksack. I'm very comfortable sitting cross-legged and can sit for long hours, even in Padmasana. I've never done farming, but I'm fairly active outdoors and am used to physical activity- so shouldn't be a problem.","I understand volunteering isn't about preferences, and I am willing to try any activity. My parents have taken me to RSSB (Radhasoami Beas) Seva since childhood and I'm used to doing whatever's needed as part of Seva.","With my budget travelling, I've lived in quite a few hostels to not see this as a discomfort.","Both my parents are initiated into the RSSB (Radhasoami, Beas) and have been doing their practices for around 8-10 years now.

I want to understand myself better and find a sense of calm and clarity that isn‚Äôt easily shaken by everyday problems. 
 
Through this program, I hope to learn practices that help me manage stress, handle life‚Äôs ups and downs with a steady mind, and become a more positive, balanced person. My goal is to find a deeper purpose and inner strength that will help me live life with a sense of peace and kindness, and to share that positivity with others.","I understand that Sadhanapada has a very strict daily routine, with almost no personal time, no days off, and strict rules to follow in the ashram. I see this as a way to push myself beyond my usual habits and comfort zone. Sticking to such a routine will help me develop discipline, focus, and strength, which are things I really want to build in myself. 
I know it might be tough at first to give up personal time and follow such a structured lifestyle, but I‚Äôm ready for it. I believe this setup will help me stay focused on my inner growth without getting distracted. I‚Äôm prepared to follow the program‚Äôs rules and routines because I trust that this experience will bring about the change I‚Äôm looking for.","I understand that the program will be physically demanding with activities like walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for long periods, and even doing tasks like farming. While it might be challenging at first, I feel ready to take it on. I know that these physical activities are part of the experience, helping to build strength, endurance, and patience. Though it may be tough at times, I‚Äôm willing to push myself and adapt, as I believe these challenges will help me grow both physically and mentally. I see it as a chance to learn to handle discomfort and build resilience.","I‚Äôm fully willing to be assigned to any type of volunteering activity, whether it‚Äôs physically demanding or office-based, for the entire program. I understand that each task, whether it involves hard physical work or something more administrative, has its own value and is an important part of the experience. I‚Äôm ready to give my best, no matter the type of work assigned, as I know that this variety of tasks will help me grow, build resilience, and learn new skills. I see this as a chance to be fully involved, learn from every experience, and contribute wherever I‚Äôm needed.","I‚Äôm comfortable with the idea of sharing my space with other volunteers, including staying in a dormitory, using shared bathrooms, and working closely during volunteer activities. I believe that sharing these spaces will help me learn to adapt, become more patient, and build a sense of community. It‚Äôs a chance to connect with others on a similar journey, learn from them, and support each other. While it may require adjusting to a new level of simplicity, I see this as part of the growth process and am ready to embrace it as part of the experience.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the entire program. They understand that I‚Äôm seeking personal growth and inner transformation, and they believe that this experience will be beneficial for me. While they‚Äôll miss having me around, they appreciate the purpose behind this journey and are encouraging me to fully commit to the program without distractions. Their support gives me confidence to dive into the experience wholeheartedly.","I have a few questions: 
What kind of support is available if I face physical or emotional challenges during the program?

Having overcome fears that previously disrupted my sleep and thoughts, I now feel a renewed sense of clarity and inner peace. 
 
At 25 years old, I see this as a pivotal moment in my life where I can build a strong foundation for my future. Through Sadhanapada, I hope to deepen my spiritual practice and integrate the lessons I've learned. I want to cultivate greater mindfulness and enhance my ability to stay grounded amidst life's challenges. 
 
Being part of a community of like-minded individuals will not only provide support and encouragement but also inspire me to stay committed to my journey. This age is an important time for personal and spiritual growth, and I want to make the most of it. 
 
Ultimately, I aim to explore new dimensions of my practice, strengthen my connection to myself, and develop a more profound sense of purpose and commitment in my daily life. Sadhanapada feels like the perfect opportunity to continue this positive momentum and grow even further on my spiritual path.","I recognize that following the strict daily schedule and having very little personal time will be a significant adjustment. However, I see this structure as essential for deepening my practice and fostering discipline. While it may feel intense at times, I believe that the focused environment will help me stay committed to my goals and enhance my spiritual growth Also now i have a work schedule of almost 12 hours a day so dedication and unwavering attitude will help me focus.But i will leave all my work and come to give my 100% on my sadhana. 
Although personal time may be limited, the experiences I gain through sadhana and community involvement will be enriching and fulfilling. Ultimately, I believe this structured approach will help me cultivate a deeper connection with myself and the practices I am committed to.","I feel ready to embrace the physical demands of the program. Over the past seven months, my daily practice of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya has already helped me build a sense of discipline and inner strength. While walking long distances, sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and engaging in physically demanding activities like farming may be challenging, I see them as valuable opportunities to push my limits and grow both physically and mentally. 
 
I understand that these activities are an integral part of the Sadhanapada experience, designed not just to test the body but to cultivate endurance, presence, and mindfulness. I‚Äôm confident that with the right attitude and willingness to adapt, I‚Äôll be able to meet these challenges and find joy in them as part of my spiritual journey.","I am fully willing to take on any kind of volunteering activity assigned to me, whether it is physically intense or office-based, for the full duration of the program. I understand that each task, no matter how challenging or routine, is an essential part of the overall Sadhanapada experience, contributing to my growth and the collective purpose of the program. 
 
I see these activities as opportunities to cultivate discipline, humility, and a sense of service. Whether working on the field or performing office duties, I am committed to approaching each task with dedication, mindfulness, and an open heart. I believe that engaging fully in any role assigned to me will help deepen my practice and allow me to contribute meaningfully to the community.","Having already lived away from home since the age of 19, and experienced sharing space with roommates during both your education and job, I don‚Äôt see communal living as a hindrance for me. In fact, those past experiences have likely strengthened my ability to adapt to new environments, work well with others, and maintain a sense of personal balance even in shared spaces. 
 
I‚Äôve learned how to coexist respectfully with others, manage shared facilities, and create a comfortable living environment despite potential challenges. These experiences have prepared me to embrace the dormitory stay, shared bathrooms, and collaborative volunteering activities during Sadhanapada with ease and openness. I look forward to the sense of community that comes from living and working closely with others, knowing that it will further enrich my journey.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the Sadhanapada program. They understand that this is a significant step in my personal and spiritual growth. Over the years, they have seen the positive changes in me through my practices and how my commitment to Inner Engineering and Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya has brought more clarity, peace, and focus into my life.","At this point, I don‚Äôt have any additional questions about the program. Everything was clearly explained during the webinar, and I feel well-informed and ready for the experience. If anything does come up later, I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll be able to seek guidance or clarification when needed.",yes

He didn't really like going to high school as he saw no point in sitting all those hours in a classroom. In 2023 he went through a sad phase that lasted three months because of some relationship gone wrong but since he went through IE in October of the same year he has been feeling great. Anger has gone away, he feels calmer and his food habits and relationships have greatly improved. 
 ‚Ä¢ He is driven by the idea of doing something for the world but understands that first he needs to find balance within himself, hence SP.
 ‚Ä¢ He has watched many youtube videos of people talking about SP and what its like living in the ashram so he feels his decision to come is totally conscious as he is well aware of all the challenges he will face in IYC.
 ‚Ä¢ Now is the right time for him because he is taking a gap year after having just completed high school.",Minor,"1) Economically dependent on parents
2) Looks na√Øve... although in November he will come to the Ashram for Marghazi month and will stay 48 days as general volunteer.

All above are cleared so moving forward with his application.",Nepali (R W S T),Fluent,Fluent,Fast,Fluent,,,,,50,Local Center Activities,,Outdoors and Others,Others,IE & some Isha volunteering,"To be very honest, I have been wanting to go through Sadhanapada for a long time, since 2 years now! The moment I found out there‚Äôs a program like this via YouTube‚Äôs recommendation, I was like I have to go through this anyhow. I had just began following Sadhguru at that time and was in 11th grade so didn‚Äôt know much about Isha Yoga Programs then.. After researching I found out IE completion & initiation was required for it then after almost two years later I got initiated just so that I can be part of this program. 
Now is the time as I finished high school & currently in a gap year hence I wish to go through it at this particular time. 
 
 
I am looking forward to grow in numerous ways through the program. In every way possible, I want to invest my time upon self transformation on the level of body, mind, emotion & energy. I hope to be balanced, strong, flexible, & fit, establish mental clarity as a student & seeker. I wanna have emotional stability & learn how to use thoughts & emotions, enhance my perception of life, deepen my sadhana in a powerfully consecrated space along with dedicated & focused Sanghas. Not only that but also lead an intense & energetic yogic life, empower myself to be friction free in the world & drop all my nonsense focusing on my inner growth through the program.","We are there for a reason and a certain purpose so I completely agree with and respect the norms & guidelines of staying in the Ashram. I understand we are not there for luxury, our focus is for something else, so I think all the above mentioned things about the program are crucial when it comes to cultivating & maintaining discipline in a seekers life.","Oh yes! Those are indeed physically demanding aspects of the program. I do not walk long distances but I intend on preparing my body for it from now on itself. Sitting cross legged wouldn‚Äôt be too much of a challenge for me as I do it all the time so I can handle that. I come from a farming background, we are farmers so I don‚Äôt really have difficulty in getting into farming activities as such, I am familiar to it & I think it‚Äôs a wonderful activity to stay connected to nature.","I‚Äôm coming there with a certain commitment to grow and transform my self so I‚Äôm willing 100% to do any kind of volunteering activity to the best of my ability no matter if they may physically intense, demanding or office based, for the full duration of the program because that is what I‚Äôm there for after all - to break my limitations!","I feel okay about sharing my space with many other volunteers as this would not be the first time I would have done it. I am well experienced in these things from early on because I‚Äôve done that previously with couple of friends in hostel & other situations. So, it is totally fine with me sharing the space with other participants.","My family feels secure and carefree about me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program. Initially, they didn‚Äôt understand about the whole thing but slowly over the course of two years they‚Äôve come to terms with whatever I‚Äôm doing and have accepted this path & our way of life. They‚Äôre happy where I‚Äôm happy.",All my questions are answered. Thank you very much.,yes

One thing that keeps bothering me is, i have somehow pulled myself out of many challenging situations without using 100% ability. It's because i lack discipline and consistency. It's always been on and off with me. I've always wondered what i would be like if i am disciplined and consistent about something. When i heard of sadhanapda and the intensity of the program, the schedule, i thought this would be the best opportunity to test myself. 
2. I'm a CA aspirant. Past 3 to 5 years of this CA journey wasn't easy for me physically and mentally, keeping upto long hours of studies and work. Especially the internship part. I felt so frustrated, irritated and helpless at times. This also resulted in me being angry, frustrated towards people around me. I have failed in handling myself in many situations which i hate the most. 
This was because of lack of clarity and balance within myself and i never want myself to be in such situations. I choose Sadhanapadha so that i can work on myself to attain that clarity and balance within myself so that i could conduct myself and function at my best. 
3. Another aspect is, past few years i have grown physically weak as a result of lack of physical activity. I find a bit challenging to have mental clarity without physical balance. So when i checked about sadhanapada, i had all the reasons to apply for it.","To be honest, that is one of the main reason which pulled me towards sadhanapada. I know it takes lot of efforts to stick to that schedule, which will test me on various levels and that's exactly what i want myself to go through.",Being habituated to long sitting hours without much physical activity at all makes the physical part more challenging. But yes I'm 100% willing to try meet those demands of the program.,"I've struggled in past to accepting and adapting to things that i don't like coming my way. That's one of the things i want to change in myself, to learn to use anything that comes my way to grow , to use it to my advantage. I think the seva aspect would help me to achieve that. So I'm willing to do any activity to the best of my ability.","I never liked sharing stay area or bathrooms with people. But the intention of getting enrolled to sadhanapada is to break my boundaries, adapt to new things and still maintain the quality of who i am. So I'm willing to adapt with the facilities provided by isha yoga centre.","3 years back, i spoke to my parents about me getting enrolled to sadhanapada, which they actually didn't take well. Also i was in middle of my CA internship, so they were concerned about my education. Hence i had made it clear to them that once i get my CA degree i will enroll to sadhanapada no matter what. They were exposed to few negative narratives regarding Isha foundation, which i have taked to them about after that. Now as i will get my CA degree, i will talk to them. I also have planned and taken care of financial aspects in my absence. In the end, only want what's best for me, and i think sadhanapada would help me achieve that. So they'll be ok with me enrolling to the program.","I just want to know, by what month will i get confirmation about my enrollment, it would be helpful for me to plan my work and few other things.",yes

I feel this is the right time for me to focus intensively towards on my spiritual growth, develop clarity and a sense of purpose through the program. Also, the chance to offer myself selflessly through 'seva' will help me understand myself more deeply and allow me to break inner limitations. This program will be a significant step toward my inner transformation and fulfilment.","I understand that following the strict daily schedule and having very little personal time is essential for the nature of the program. I view the challenge of having no days off and to adhering strictly to the program‚Äôs guidelines as a valuable opportunity for deepening my commitment to inner growth.

I understand that volunteering is a crucial aspect of the program and serves as a tool for inner growth. I am open to all tasks as they will provide an opportunity for learn more about myself in the process. Engaging in different type of activities will help develop greater adaptability and understanding of self as well as others.","I have completed most of my programs from the ashram, and I feel comfortable sharing my space with other volunteers in dormitory accommodations and shared bathroom facilities.","My family is supportive of my decision to stay at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of the program.

 ‚Ä¢ Attended IE online in December 2023 and was deeply touched by the program. The subject of responsibility really struck a cord with him and he now feels a mother to the world.
 ‚Ä¢ Would like to spend the most amount of time in the ashram, in a structured and systematized program without any distractions to learn new practices and deepen his Sadhana.
 ‚Ä¢ After dealing with the death of both his parents between 2018-2021 now his life is in good order so he feels it's the right time to attend SP because he can give himself fully to it.

I really want to be part of this powerful system and I feel like sadhanapada is a great step towards this. I want to stretch myself to the maximum and beyond I want to be uncomfortable and challenge myself and go through that consciously and gracefully and I feel like this is the right time for me to join sadhanapada as when I reflect upon my life I can clearly see that it has been falling together to allow this for me, being alive during Sadhgurus era and everything that I went through throughout my life makes me confident that I am meant to be on this spiritual path and it is my time now to enhance it and take solid steps towards it. I hope that through the program I will be able to grow mentally and spiritually I hope and I'm actually confident that I will come out of this program a totally different being I will be more conscious, more inclusive, more confident and committed even more towards my spiritual growth and towards being a walking temple as Sadhguru wants us to be",This is actually what I am looking for. I really feel like I need it in order to grow and I really want to to test myself beyond my limitations and I'm confident that I will go through it gracefully.,It's exciting for me I really love to move and appreciate the body that I have so I must use it and I'm an active person all my life I was involved in a lot of sports since I was a child and now I literally walk every day sometimes for a couple of hours. My isha practices are helping in this too I'm always cross legged and moving my body and I really need that more intensity in sadhanapada to even become more physically able to be more and more active.,Always willing for any kind of volunteering activities.,It's amazing it will make me feel more engaged and will let me see in front of me the development of others which will make me happy and confident.,The are okay with that they know that this is what I want and they respect it.,Nothing in mind right now maybe when we have the call some questions might pop up.,yes

Currently I am in the last year of Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and by next year April -May, i will complete my degree. So after this completion , I feel the most crucial thing which is needed to be happen is Sadhanapada , as sharings from Annas and Akkas in Linga seva gave me glimpse of what it means to be in ashram and in presence of Sadhguru. So the Only thing which I feel can really make me set right for anything and everything which can take place in this tenure of life and make best out of it is Sadhanapada . And also it can be a tool to deepen clarity.","This year I got a chance to volunteer for linga seva and it was an most influential experience, the 10 days totally changed everything about me , I was with total new sense of life . So, when I was a part of linga seva, everyday started at early morning 4.30 am in Dhyanlinga and it lasted till 10.30 pm with meeting with Swami. So even though being new to such schedule, it was hard to notice how's days passed . Being with Annas and Akkas made feel every task simple. So similarly with grace of Sadhguru this Sadhanapada will happen with ease .","Even it sounds hard , but I have applied for Sadhanapada to break all limitations so this things are must . And I believe this all activities will happen with ease with Sadhgurus grace.",I would love to do any type of work as being a volunteer itself means being ready for anything which needs to be done.,"It's family-like, as Annas and Akkas share not only living spaces but also experiences and they guide if anything is done in a wrong way . And also they motivate in many ways. So it's an amazing experience being with them.","Namaskaram üôè 
Currently, my family has some concerns about me staying at the Isha Yoga Center for the full duration of Sadhanapada. Their hesitation comes from the significant changes they noticed in me after I returned from Linga Seva‚Äîmy eating habits, daily routine, and behavior shifted so much that they fear I may not return to the same lifestyle or even come back home. I understand that these concerns arise from their love and care, and it‚Äôs natural for them to feel this way. 
 
However, after witnessing the positive transformation in me, both my parents and some of our neighbors were inspired to take the Inner Engineering program offline. I believe that as they deepen their own practices through Shambhavi Mahamudra, they will gradually understand the immense value of Sadhanapada. Following Sadhguru‚Äôs guidance, I have also made it a point to express more love and care towards my parents, which is already fostering greater understanding and harmony. 
 
I am confident that over time they will appreciate why this program is essential for me. And if not right away, I trust that when they see the deeper transformation in me after completing Sadhanapada, their perspective will naturally shift. My focus is to remain fully involved in the process and to keep nurturing our bond with love, allowing it to dissolve any lingering concerns.","Nope , I don't have any questions.

After spending 3 months as a generally volunteer in the Isha Yoga Center of Coimbatore (January until April) and doing my best to be as involved with the Sadhanas, the Sevas and all the opportunities of this wonderful space, I needed to return home and evaluate the impact of this incredibly intense experience.

Now, I strongly believe that Sadhanapada will help me go a step further in my spiritual journey and growing towards a more vibrant body, a more joyful mind, a heart full of love and ecstatic energies. With this program, I wish to become more conscious and inclusive, as well as becoming more perceptive and I have the precious and rare opportunity to be completely devoted to the program form July 2025 until May 2026.",I managed it for 3 months at the beginning of this year. I realized that it will be challenging and believe I could be fully devoted to it and make the most out of it.,I feel in good physical shape and confident with physical demands (this year's sadhanas and healthier lifestyle helped quite a lot!).,I am fully willing and will put aside any pre-concieved ideas or preferences I might have. I realized how trying to be competely and joyfully involved in anything that I do is a crucial step in my spiritual path.,"I feel completely ok about this. I have experienced it at IYC at the beginning of this year and, even if it took some getting use to, it ended up being very smooth.",They noticed how my 3-months stay changed me for the better and they are therefore fully supportive regarding my application for Sadhanapada.,"There are still some Isha programs I would like to participate to (BSP, Guru Pooja and Samyama). Would it be possible to do these during Sadhanapada? 
Also I would like to volonteer for many programs and yoga classes (IE retreat, Shoony Intensive, Hatha yoga classes, Linga Seva, Devi Seva...), can I do this during Sadhanapada?

To go on and on I need to prepare myself but I don't have any issues with the demands, the more the use my body the lighter I feel.","I am fully ready. Even if its an activity which looks boring, I will do it willingly because when I was in the Ashram the last day I volunteered at the TV area and I thought this would be boring as I had to stand and welcome people for the whole day but that was actually surprising and really transformed me. As I said Namaskaram to all the visitors who were entering the Isha Yoga. It had so much impact on me I started looking at people like they are my family. The way the people said Namaskaram to me. That Bhakti towards another human being increased a lot. I would have said Namaskaram to almost 300 to 400 people that day, by the end of the day I was filled with love and joy. I can still feel that day. This happened only because I was willing to do it and to break all my limitations i have. By doing it willingly I gained a lot from it.

Sadhanapada offers a unique opportunity to step away from distractions and focus on aligning myself with higher possibilities. The energy of the program, combined with the disciplined practices, feels like the right environment to deepen my connection with the inner self, cultivate clarity, and live with greater purpose. This is a time for me to surrender to the process and evolve on a spiritual level.","While I recognize that following such a strict daily schedule will be a challenge, I believe it‚Äôs a necessary step for my growth. The rigor of the program aligns with my desire to develop a more disciplined and mindful approach to life. The lack of personal time will push me to confront my inner struggles, which I see as an opportunity for deeper transformation. I am committed to the process and willing to abide by the guidelines, knowing that they are designed to bring out the best in me.","I see the physical demands of the program as a beautiful opportunity to reconnect with my body and nature. Activities like walking long distances, sitting cross-legged, and farming will help me build strength, endurance, and mindfulness. Embracing these challenges with a positive attitude will enhance my discipline and resilience. I believe that engaging in such activities will allow me to deepen my sadhana and contribute meaningfully to the ashram's community while growing physically and spiritually.","I am fully willing to participate in any form of volunteering, whether physically intense or office-based. I believe that seva, or selfless service, is at the heart of spiritual growth. Being involved in any activity, no matter how challenging, is part of surrendering my ego and embracing a life of service. I trust that each task will offer its own unique lessons and opportunities for growth.","Sharing space with others, particularly in a dormitory setting, will be a new experience for me. While it may be uncomfortable at first, I am prepared to embrace the experience as part of my journey towards letting go of attachments and personal preferences. Living in a community setting will teach me valuable lessons about cooperation, humility, and adapting to different circumstances, all of which are essential for inner growth.","My family is understanding and spiritually active, so they are supportive of my decision to participate in Sadhanapada.

After reading ""Karma"" I have realized my path should be ""being, doing, and having."" My life to this point has been about achievements and goals - medical school, residency, fellowship, board certification, professorship, being in a ""perfect"" relationship, climbing mountains, performing in dance teams. Now that my long term relationship has ended I have started to question who and what I am in life. If I am no longer a future wife of my former partner then I started to question the other labels I have created - hiker, dancer, doctor, professor, daughter, sister. Realizing they will all too come to an end at some point in time, it leaves me with more questions than answers as to why I am here and what this life is truly about. I would like to start from the beginning and focus on ""being"" human. If I understand myself better and have a sense of fulfillment within, then my ""doing"" (interaction) with others is a natural byproduct and then the ""having"" is a natural second byproduct of that. If those ""labels"" I have created for myself (dancer, hiker, doctor, professor, etc) come to an end, then I will still be a whole person because I have focused on the ""being"" aspect. Sadhanapada would give me the dedicated and focused time to go inward and focus on ""being"", leaving the labels behind and blossoming from within. With this period of introspection I could then return to my medical school, hospital, friends/family with more joy, peace and creativity. It would in turn affect those around me - students, patients, friends/family. Life should be an expression of your happiness and not a pursuit of it. Sadhanapada will be the first step in finding my happiness within.","I look forward to the strict daily schedule within the ashram. Having no ""days off"" means you are continually striving for something greater that will transform you.","I enjoy long distance hiking - I summitted Kilimanjaro in December 2023 and climbed grand canyon (north rim to south rim, 25 miles in 15 hours in September 2024). I also enjoy doing weight lifting (4-5 days a week) and kuchipudi classes (once a week).
